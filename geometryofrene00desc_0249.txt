LI.[²⁴⁶¹ so that LP could not be inscribed in it, every root of the pro-
posed equation would be imaginary: and the same would be true if the
circle IP¹²⁴⁷1 were so small that it did not cut the curve ACN at any
point. The circle IP will in general cut the curve ACN in six differ-
ent points, so that the equation can have six distinet rootsfffll But if
it cuts it in fewer points, this indicates that some of the roots are equal

[²⁴⁷¹ That is, the circle PCN.

[²⁴8¹ The points determining these roots must be points of intersection of the
circle with the main branch of the curve obtained, that is, of the branch ACN.
