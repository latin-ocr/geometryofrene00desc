THIRD BOOK

Now, when it is clear that the proposed problem is solid. whether
the equation upon which its solution depends is of the fourth degree or
only of the third. its roots can always be found by any one of the three
conic sections, or even by some part of one of them, however small,
together with only circles and straight lines. I shall content myself
with giving here a general rule for finding them all by means of a para-
bola, since that is in some respects the simplest of these curves.

First, remove the second term of the proposed equation. if this is not
already zero, thus reducing it to the form 3³ = ssapsssoeq. if the given
equation is of the third degree, or 3⁴ = ssapz²ssa³qsssa³²n if it is of the

fourth degree. By choosing α as the unit, the former may be written
