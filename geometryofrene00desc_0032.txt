GEOMETRY

Thus; all the unknown quantities can be expressed in terms of a sin-
gle quantity‚‘¹⁶¹ whenever the problem can be constructed by means of
circles and straight lines, or by conic sections, or even by some other
curve of degree not greater than the third or fourtli.[¹⁷¹

But Ι shall not stop to explain this in more detail, because Ι should
deprive you ot' the pleasure of mastering it yourself, as well as of the
advantage of training your mind by working over it, which is in my
opinion the principal benefit to be derived from this science. Because,
I find nothing here so difficult that it cannot be worked out by any one
at all familiar with ordinary geometry and with algebra, who will con-
sider carefully all that is set forth in this treatise.[¹⁸¹

[¹⁸¹ In the Introduction to the 1637 edition of La Geonzfitrie, Descartes made
the following remark: “In my previous writings Ι have tried to make my mean-
ing clear to everybody; but Ι doubt if this treatise will be read by anyone not
familiar with the books on geometry. and so Ι have thought it superfluous to repeat
demonstrations contained in them.'’ See Oczwres de Descartesv edited by Charles
Adam and Paul Tamiery, Paris, 1897—1910, vol. VI, p. 368. In a letter written
to Mersenne in 1637 Descartes says: “I do not enjoy speaking in praise of myself,
but since few people can understand my geometry‚ and since you wish me to
give you mv opinion of it, I think it well to sav that it is all Ι could hope for.
and that in La Dioptrique and Les Mffteores, Ι have only tried to persuade people
that my method is better than the ordinary one. Ι have proved this in my geom-
etry, for in the beginning Ι have solved a question which, according to Pappus,
could not be solved by any of the ancient geometers.

“Moreover, what I have given in the second book on the nature and properties
of curved lines. and the method of examining them, is. it seems to me. as far
beyond the treatment in the ordinary geometry, as the rhetoric of Cicero is beyond
the a, b, c of children. . . .

“As to the suggestion that what Ι have written could easily have been gotten
from Vieta, the very fact that iny treatise is hard to understand is due to my
attempt to put nothing in it that Ι believed to be known either by him or by any
one else. . . . I begin the rules of my algebra with what Vieta wrote at the
very end of his book. De emendatione (imitationum. . . . Thus. Ι begin where
he left off.” Oenw'es de Descartcs, publiffes par Victor Coztsin, Paris, 1824, Vol.
VI, p. 294 (hereafter referred to as Cousin).

In another letter to Mersenne, written April 20, 1646, Descartes writes as
follows: “I have omitted a number of things that might have made it (the geom-
etry) clearer, but Ι did this intentionally. and would not have it otherwise. The
only suggestions that have been made concerning changes in it are in regard to
rendering it clearer to readers, but most of these are so inalicious that I am com-
pletely disgusted with the1n.'' Cousin, Vol. IX, p. 553.

In a letter to the Princess Elizabeth‚ Descartes says: “In the solution of a
geometrical problem Ι take care, as far as possible, to use as lines of reference
parallel lines or lines at right angles: and I use no theorems except those which
assert that the sides of similar triangles are proportional, and that ιιι a right
triangle the square of the hypotenuse is eoual to the suin of the squares of the
sides. I do not hesitate to introduce several unknown quantities. so as to reduce the
question to such terms that it shall depend only on these two theorems.’' Cousin,
Vol. IX, p. 143.
