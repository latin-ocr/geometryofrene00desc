the lines AB, AD, and EF are given in position, the distance from A
to E is known. If we call this distance k, then ΕΒ = k -Ι- ,1η although
ER z k—‚v when Β 1165 between E and A, and E=-—k -Ι- x when E
lies between A and B. Now the angles of the triangle ESB being
given, the ratio of BE to RS is known. We may call this ratio z .·d.
