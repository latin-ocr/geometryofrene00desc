Then Ι take on the curve an arbitrary point, as C, at which we will
suppose the instrument applied to describe the curve. Then Ι draw
through C the line CB parallel to GA. Since CB and BA are unknown
and indeterminate quantities‚ I shall call one of them N and the other x.
To the relation between these quantities Ι must consider also the known
quantities which determine the description of the curve. as CA, which
Ι shall call a: KL, which Ι shall call b; and NL parallel to (ΞΑ, which

I shall call c. Then Ι say that as NL is to LK, or as c is to b, so CB, or

y, is to RK, which is therefore equal to gy. Then BL is eqnal to

g3r—b, and AL is equa] to x -Ι- ξ y—b. Moreover‚ as CB is to LE,

that is. as 31 is to Ξ ‚xv—b. so AG or a is to LA or x—l-} y—b. Multi-

plying the second by the third, we get {ky — ab equal to

b
xyl-fo—bm

which is obtained by intiltiplying the first by the last. Therefore, the

required equation is

ff=w—{w†w—w
