the angle ILC is a right angle, it follows that the curve NC is a circle.
A similar treatment of any of the other cases offers no difficulty.

Since all equations of degree not higher than the second are included
in the discussion just given, not only is the problem of the ancients
relating to three or four lin'es completely solved, but also the whole
problem of what they called the composition of solid loci, and conse-
quently that of plane loci‚‘since they are included under solid loci.[¹²⁴¹
For the solution of any one of these problems of loci is nothing more
than the finding of a point for whose complete determination one con-

neither x² nor y2 but only ,ῃ occurs, and the case in which a constant term occurs,

are omitted by Descartes The various kinds of solid loci represented oy the equa-

(1) If all the terms of the right member are zero except ἴ the equation repre-

sents an hyperbola referred to its asymptotes. (2) If Τ is not present, there are

several cases, as follows: (a) If the quantity under the radical sign is zero or a

q perfect square, the equation represents a straight line: (b) If this quantity is not

a perfect square and if ἦ ,2τ zo, the equation represents a parabola; (c) If it is

not a perfect souare and if ξι x2 is negative the equation represents a ircle or an

ellipse; (d) If ἐμ is positive, the equation represents a hyperbole.. Rabue1‚p.248.
