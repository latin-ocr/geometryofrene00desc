b2c2d2

which ¹k⁴=s e2

 

, From the third term we get the second quantity
9²:3e2—4be—26d†b²†d2.

From the next to the last term we get h, the next to the last quantity,

[156]

which is
2b²c²d² - 2bc²d2

'²³² ⁶2³ εἳ

 

 

In the same way we should proceed in this order. until the last quantity
is found.
Then from the corresponding term (here the fourth) we may find
v, and we have
— 283 3be² b²e Zce Zbc bc² 6-2ίῖ
- d2

 

v — 4- - †⁶’†—†J- essa

α’“2 d² d d
or putting y for its equa] e, we get

2y³ 3by² b2y ch Zbc bc² &²6²

 

v————
