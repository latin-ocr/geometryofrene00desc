SECOND BOOK

I must not, however, fail to prove the statements already made. For
this purpose, take any point C on the first part of the first oval, and
draw the straight line CP normal to the curve at C. This can be done
by the method given above,[¹⁷¹¹ as follows:

Let AG=b, AF=c‚ FC=c-{—z. Suppose the ratio of d to e, which
Ι always take here to measure the refractive power of the lens under
consideration, to represent the ratio of AS to Ao or similar lines used
to describe the oval. Then

GC=b-{,2‚

whence
- bcd‘2 — bede -1- &dez ÷ce²2

Ap„ bde÷cd²÷d²2—e²2 ⁸

 

From P draw ΡΩ perpendicular to FC, aud ΡΝ perpendicular to GC.¹¹⁷²¹
Now if ΡΩ 2 PN=d: e, that is, if PQ: ΡΝ is equal to the same
ratio as that between the lines which measure ‘the refraction of the
convex glass AC, ‘then a ray passing from F to C must be refraeted

toward G upon entering the glass. This follows at once from dioptrics.

¹¹⁷¹¹ See a e 115.
Ι [¹⁷²¹ Hercle) {Q is the sine of the angle of incidence and PN is the sine of the
angle of refraction. The ray FC is reflected along CG.
