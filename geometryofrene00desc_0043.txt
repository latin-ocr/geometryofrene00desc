FIRST BOO K

quoniam non est aliquid contentzun pluribus quom tribus dimensioni-
bus.” ¹³³¹

Here I beg you to observe in passing that the considerations that
forced ancient writers to use arithmetical ternis in geometry‚ thus mak-
ing it impossible for them to proceed beyond a point where they could
see clearly the relation between the two subjects, caused much obscur-
ity and embarrassment, in their attempts at explanation.

Pappus proceeds as follows:

“Aequiescunt autem his, qui paulo onte talia interpretati sun-t: neque
unum aliquo pacto comprehensibile significantes quod his continetur.
Licebit autem per conjunctos proportiones licec, ὅ dicere ὅθ demonstrare
universe in dictis proportionibus, atque his in hunc moduni. Si ab
aliquo puncto od positione datas rectos lineas ducantur rectce linece in
dotis onyulis, ὃ dota sit proportio conjuncta ex eo, quani habet una
ductarmn od unam, ὅ altero ad alteram, ἔτ alio od aliam, ὅ reliqua ad
datam lineam, si sint septem: si vero octo, δὲ’ reliqua od reliquam:
punctum continyet positione datas lineas. Et similiter quotcumque sint

¹³³¹ This may be somewhat freely translated as follows: “The problem of the
locus related to three or four lines, about which he (Apollonius) boasts so proudly,
giving no credit to the writer who has preceded him, is of this nature: If three
straight lines are given in position, and if straight lines be drawn from one and
the same point, making given angles with the three given lines; and if there be
given the ratio of the rectangle contained by two of the lines so drawn to the
square of the other, the point lies on a solid locus given in position, namely, one
of the three conic sections.

“Again, if lines be drawn making given angles with four'straight lines given
in position, and if the rectangle of two of the lines so drawn bears a given ratio
to the rectangle of the other two; then, in like manner, the point lies on a conic
Section given in position. It has been shown that to only two lines there corre-
sponds a plane locus. But if there be given more than four lines, the point gen-
erates loci not known up to the present time (that is. impossible to determine by
common methods), but merely called ‘lines'. It is not clear what they are, or
what their properties. One of them, not the first but the most manifest, has been
examined‚ and this has proved to be helpful. (Paul Tannery‚ in the Oeuvres de
Descartes, differs with Descartes in his translation of Pappus. He translates as
follows: Et on n'a fait la synthese d' aucune de ces lignes, ni montre qu‘elle servit
pour ces licuit, pas meme pour celle qui semblerait la premiere et la plus indique‘e.)
These, however, are the propositions concerning them.

“If from any point straight lines be drawn making given angles with five
straight lines given in position, and if the solid rectangular parallelepiped contained
by three of the lines so drawn bears a given ratio to the solid rectangular paral-
lelepiped contained by the other two and any given line whatever, the point lies
on a ‘line’ given in position. Again, if there be six lines, and if the solid con-
tained by three of the lines bears a given ratio to the solid contained by the other
three lines, the point also lies on a ‘line’ given in position. But if there be more
than six lines, we cannot say whether a ratio of something contained by four
lines is given to that which is contained by the rest, since there is no figure of
more than three dimensions.''
