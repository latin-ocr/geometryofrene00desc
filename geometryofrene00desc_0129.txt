required, it is not necessary to go further.

In the same way, the second equation found abovefff· namely,

From these two equations‚ six others may be obtained, which serve to
determine the six quantities f, gy, li, k, v, and s. It is easily seen that
to whatever class the given curve may belong„ this method will always
furnish just as many equations as we necessarily have unknown quan-
tities. ln order to solve these equaffions, and ultimately to find v, which
is the only value really wanted (the others being used only as means
of finding v). we first determine f the first unknown in the above
expression, from the second term. Thus, f=2e—-2b. Then in the last

terms we can find k, the last unknown in the same expression, from
