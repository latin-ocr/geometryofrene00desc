Obtaining the roots of these two equations, we get the same results as
if we had obtained the roots of the equation containing 95⁴, namely. one

true root, &sy-{- 2, and three false ones, xl 7 — 2, 2 -1- v 2 , and ‘2 - xl?
Again, given ,2-⁴*4‚1·2—8.2·÷35 = O. we have 3¹⁰—8374—124y2—64 ΞΟ,
and since the root of the latter equation is 16, we must write
,2·2—4.2-†5 = O and ‚1·²†4.2-÷7 z Ο. For in this case,

and 4-1'2-Lp4-g-,7

Now these two equations have no roots either true or false,¹²²³¹ whence
we know that the four roots of the original equation are imaginary;
and that the problem whose solution deoends upon this equation is
plane, but that its construction is impossible, because the given quanti-
ties cannot be united.¹²²⁴¹ ’
Similarly, given

since we have found 3v² = α2 —l— 62, we must write
