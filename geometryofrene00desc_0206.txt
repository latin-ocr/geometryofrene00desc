done it is useless to pursue the question further, for it follows inevit-
ably that the problem is solid. If, however, the value of γ’] can be
found, we can by means of it separate the preceding equation into two
others, each of the second degree, whose roots will be the same as
those of the original equatiou. Instead of —l— x* ὲ pff ζ qx ss r= O,

write the two equations

—l— ³6²-yx4- 35stss {25ss qu :O
and ψ 22 ÷yx ÷ 7}st ὲ {pss ἔγ =0.

For the ambiguous signs write -l- ἷρ in each new equation, when p

has a positive sign, and - sssp when p has a negative sign, but write
—st- ᾗ when we have -yx, and — ἔγ when we have -Ι- yx, provided q has

a positive sign, and the opposite when q has a negative sign. It is then
easy to determine all the roots of the proposed equation, and conse-
quently to construet the problem of which it contains the solution, by
the exclusive use of circles and straight lines. For example, writing
ννῦ — 34324 —f— 313322 — 400: O instead of x* — 172³ — 202· — 6 =O we
find that 32² = l6; then, instead of the original equation

—l— x4 —- 17,ι·2 - 202³ — 6 ——- O

write the two equations —l— x² — 42· -- 3 Ξ O and -l—ffi-l——lx -Ι- 2 z O. -

For, y = 4, 3*st = 8, p = 17, q Ξ 20, and therefore
