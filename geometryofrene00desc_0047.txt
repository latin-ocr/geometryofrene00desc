plest, and yet was not the most iinportant.¹³⁸¹ This led me to try to find
out whether, by my own method, I could go as far as they had gonew

First. Ι discovered that if the question be proposed for only three,
four, or five lines, the required points can be found by elementary
geometry, that is, by the use of the ruler and compasses only, and the
application of those principles that Ι have already explained, except
in the case of five parallel lines. In this case, and in the cases where
there are six, seven, eight, or nine given lines, the required points can
always be found by means of the geometry of solid loci,¹⁴⁰¹ that is, by
using some one of the three conic sections. Here, again, there is an
exception in the case of nine parallel lines. For this and the cases of
ten, eleven, twelve‚ or thirteen given lines. the required points may be
found by means ot‘ a curve of degree next higher than that of the conic
sections. Again, the case of thirteen parallel lines must be excluded
for which, as well as for the cases of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and
seventeen lines, a curve of degree next higher than the preceding must
be used: and so on indefinitely.

Next, Ι have found that when only three or four lines are given, the
required points lie not only all on one of the conic sections but some-
times on the circumference of a circle or even on a straight line.¹⁴¹¹

When there are five, six, seven, or eight lines. the required points
lie on a curve of degree next higher than the conic sections, and it is
impossible to imagine such a curve that may not satisfy the conditions
of the probleni; but the required points may possibly lie on a conic
section‚ a circle, or a straight line. If there are nine, ten, eleven, or
twelve lines, the required curve is only one degree higher than the pre-
ceding, but any such curve may meet the requirements. and so on to
infinity.

[³⁹] Descartes gives here a brief summary of his solution. which he amplifies
later.

¹⁴⁰³ This term was commonly applied by matheinaticians of the seventeenth cen-
tury to the three conic sections, while the straight line and circle were called plane

loci, and other curves linear loci. See Fermat, Isagyoye ad Locos Planos et Solidos,
Toulouse, 1679.
