as extracting the square root, cube root. etc.‚ of the given line.[³¹ And
Ι shall not hesitate to introduce these arithmetical terms into geometry‚
for the sake of greater clearnesS.

For example, let AB be taken as unity, and let it be required
to multiply BD by BC. Ι have only to join the points A and C, and
draw DE parallel to CA; then BE is the product of BD and BC.

If it be required to divide BE by BD, I join E and D, and draw AC
parallel to DE; then BC is the result of the division.

If the square root ot' GH is desired, I add. along the same
straight line, FG equal to unity; then, bisecting FH at K, Ι describe
the circle FIH about K as a center, and draw from G a perpendicular
and extend it to Ι, and GI is the required root. I do not speak here ot*
cube root, or other roots, since Ι shall speak more conveniently of them
later.

Osten it is not necessary thus to draw the lines on paper. but it is
sufficient to designate each by a single letter. Thus, to add the lines
BD and GH, Ι call one a and the other b, and write α -Ι- b. Then α —b

will indicate that b is subtracted from a: ab that α ἱ5 multiplied by b,-

Ξ that α is divided by b‚· aa or α2 that α is multiplied by itself: <1³ that

this result is multiplied by a, and so on. indefinitely.[⁴¹ Again, if I wish

 

to extract the square root of a2—l—b2‘, Ι write vahl—b& if Ι wish to

 

 

extract the cube root of 03—b3—l—c1b2, Ι write xsssffl—bss—l—abf, and sirn-
ilarly for other roots.[⁶¹ Here it must be observed that by αἲ, b3, and
similar expressions, Ι ordinarily mean only simple lines, which, how-
’ ever, Ι name squares, cubes, etc.‚ so that Ι may make use of the terms
employed in algebra.1⁶¹

[³¹ While in arithmetic the only exact roots obtainable are those of perfect
powers. in geometry a length can be found which will represent exactly the square
root of a given line, even though this line be not commensurable with unity. Of
other roots, Descartes speaks later.

1⁴¹Descartes uses (1³, a4. αὖ, ast. and so on. to represent the respective powers
of α, but he uses both aa and α2 without distinction. For example, he often has

30²

aabb, but he also uses {br-2.

¹⁶¹ Descartes writes: §Cast —bss-l-abb. See original, page 299. line 9.

[θ] At the time this was written, 0² was commonly considered to mean the sur-
face of a square whose side is a, and b³ to mean the volume of a cube whose side
is b,· while b4, b⁵, were unintelligible as geometric forms. Descartes here says
that α2 does not have this meaning, but means the line obtained by constructing a
third proportional to 1 and α, and so on.
