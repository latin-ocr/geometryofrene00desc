We'can even draw a straight line at right angles to this curve at a
given point, simply by drawing a straight line in each plane normal to
the curve lying in that plane at the foot Of the perpendicular drawn
from the given point of the three-dimensional curve to that plane and
then drawing two other planes, each passing through One of the straight
lines and perpendicnlar to the plane containing it; the intersection of
these two planes will be the required normal.

And so Ι think I have omitted nothing essentia] to an understanding

of curved lines.
