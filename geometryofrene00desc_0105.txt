SECOND BOOK

If the problem of the ancients be proposed concerning five lines, all
parallel, the required point will evidently always lie on a straight line.
Suppose it be proposed concerning five lines with the following condi-
t1ons:

(l) Four of these lines parallel and the fifth perpendicular to each
of the others ,

(2) The lines drawn from the required point to meet the given lines
at right angles;

(3) The parallelepiped¹¹²⁰¹ composed of the three lines drawn to meet
three of the parallel lines must be equal to that composed of three lines.
namely. the one drawn to meet the fourth parallel, the one drawn to
meet the perpendicular, and a certain given line.

This is, with the exception of the preceding one. the simplest pos-

sible case. The point required will lie on a curve generated by the

motion of a parabola in the following way:

1¹²⁰¹That is, the Droduct of the numerical measures of these lines.
