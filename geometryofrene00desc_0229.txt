about E as center, passing through A. Then FL and LA are the
required mean proportionals.[²³¹¹

Again‚ let it be required to divide the angle NOP, or rather,
the circular arc ΝΩΤΡ, into three equal parts. Let ΝΩ = 1 be
the radius of the circle, NP = q be the chord subtending the given arc,
and ΝΩ =z be the chord subtending one-third of that arc; then the
equation is :3³ =33¹—q. For, drawing ΝΩ, ΟΩ and OT, and drawing
ΩΞ parallel to TO, it is obvious that ΝΟ is to ΝΩ as ΝΩ is to ΩΒ as
ΩΒ is to RS. Since ΝΟ = 1 and ΝΩ = 3, then ΩΒ = :3² and RS = z³;
and since NP or q lacks only RS or 3³ of being three times ΝΩ or 3, we
have q ——- 35—53 or 33 = 33—q.[²³²¹

Describe the parabola FAG so that CA, one-half its latus rectum,

shall be equal to ἐὴ take CD— ἐξ* and the perpendicular DE- ὲ q;

then describe the circle FAyG about E as center, passing through A.
This circle cuts the parabola in three points, F, q, and G, besides the

vertex, A. This shows that the given equation has three roots‚ namely,
the two true roots‚ GK and qk, and one false root, FL.1²³³¹ The smaller
