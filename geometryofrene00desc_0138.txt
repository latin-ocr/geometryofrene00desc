may b'e described in the following way: Drawing the two straight lines
FA and AR (p. 11-1) intcrsecting at A under any angle, Ι 6110056 arbi-
trarily a point F on one of them (more or less distant from A accord-
ing as the Oval is to be large or small). With F as center Ι describe a
circle cutting FA at a point a little beyond A, as at the point 5. Ι then
draW the straight line 56⁸⁶* cutting AR at 6, so that Ass is less than Ab,
and so that A& is to A5 in any given ratio, as, for example, that which
measures the refracti(›11,[¹⁶²¹ if the oval is to be 11560 for dioptrics This
being done, Ι take an arbitrary point G in the line FA on the same side
as the point 5, 50 that AF is to GA in any given ratio. Next, along the
line Ao Ι lay off RA equa] to GA, and with G as center and a radius
equal to Ro Ι describe a circle. This circle will cut the first one in two
points 1, l‚[²⁶³¹ through which the first of the required ovals must pass.

Next, with F as center Ι describe a circle which cuts FA as little
nearer to or farther from A than the point 5, as, for example, at the
point 7. Ι then draw 78 parallel to 56 and with G as center and a radius
equal to RS Ι describe another circle. This circle will cut the one
through 7 in the points 1, 1³⁰⁴] which are points of the same oval. We
can thus find as many points as may be desired, by drawing lines paral-
lel to 78 and describing circles with F and G as centers.

¹¹⁶¹] The confusion resulting from the use of Arabio figures to designate points
is here apparent.

[¹⁶²¹ That is. the ratio corresponding to the index of refraction.

[¹⁶³¹ “Au point 1.”
[¹⁶⁴¹ “Au point l.”
