point-C, the intersection of the parabola and the ruler, will describe
the curve ACN, which is to bc used in the construction of the proposed
problem.

Having thus described the curve, take a point L in the line RK on the

concave side of the parabola, and such that BL ε DE: :3th& then lay

which we may, for the sake of brevity, set equal to LI„ Join L and I, and

describe the circle LPI on LI as diameter; then inscribe in this circle

 

the line LP equal to &js-*7⁵³ 4⁷4. Finally‚ describe the circle PCN about

Η
Ι as center and passing through P. This circle will cut or touch the
curve ACN in as many points as the equation has roo1ts; and hence the
perpendiculars CG, NR, ΩΟ, and so on, dropped from these points
upon RK, will be the required roots. This rule never fails nor does it
admit of any exceptions.
For if the quantity s were so large in proportion to the others, p, q,

r, t, u, that the line LP was greater than the diameter of the circle
