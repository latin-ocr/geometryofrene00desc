mined: Since the· problem relates to only three or four lines. it is obvi-
ous that we shall always have such terms, although sorne of them may
vanish and the signs may all vary.[¹⁰¹¹

After this, Ι make KI 601131 and parallel to BA, and cutting off on
BC 3 segment RK 601131 to m (since the expression for BC contains
-1-111; if this were ——m, Ι should have drawn H< on the other side of
ΑΒΓΜ] while if m were zero, Ι would not have drawn H< at all). Then

Ι draw IL so that IK z KL Ξ ε : n3 that is, so that if IK is equa] to x,

KL is 601131 to ἔτ. 111 the same way Ι know the ratio of KL to IL,

which Ι may call n ;α, 50 that if KL is 601131 to ἕλ’, IL is equal tu

- {x ; if this were -Ι- {x Ι should take L between K and C Ῥω] while if

gx were 601131 to zer0‚ Ι should not draw IL.

This being done, there remains the expression

[¹⁰¹¹ Having obtained the value of BC algebraically, Descartes now proceeds to

construet the length BC geometrically, term by term. He considers BC equal to
