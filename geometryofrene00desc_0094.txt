the point N will be the vertex of this diameter.¹¹²⁸¹ It is then a simple

matter to determine the curve. according to the second and third prob-

lems of the first book of Apollonius.

[120]

When the locus is a hyperbola and m² is positive, if 0² is equal to

zero or less than 4pm we must draw the line MOP from the center M
parallel to LC, and draw (ΞΡ parallel to LM, and take ΜΟ equal to

 

while if ox is equal to zero, ΜΟ must be taken equal to m. Then con-
sidering O as the vertex of this hyperbola, the diameter being ΟΡ and

the line applied in order being (ΞΡ, its latus rectum is

[¹¹⁸] If the equation contains -m2 and -l-nx, then „2 must be greater than
4ml1, otherwise the problem is impossible.
