impares vel pares multitudine, cum hcec, ut dixi, loco ad quatuor lineas
respondeant, nullum iyitur posuerunt ita ut linea nota sit, &affl

The question, then, the solution 01 which was begun by Euclid and
carried farther by Apollonius, but was completed by no one, is this:

Having three, four or more lines given in position, it is first required
to find a point from which as many other lines may be drawn, each
making a given angle with One of the given lines, so that the rectangle
01 two 01 1116 111165 50 drawn shall bear a given ratio to the square 01
1116 third (11 there be only three) ; 01 10 1116 rectangle 01 1116 011161 two
(if there be four), or again, that the parallelepiped¹³⁵³ constructed upon
three shall bear a given ratio to that upon the other 11νο and any given
line (if there be five), or to the parallelepiped upon the other three (11
there be six) ; 01 (11 there be seven) that the product obtained by mul-
tiplying four 01 1116111 together shall bear a given ratio to the product
01 1116 011161 three, or (11 there be eight) that the product of four 01
1116111 511311 bear a given ratio to the product 01 1116 other 10111. Thus
the question admits 01 extension to any number 01 111165.

Then, since there is always an infinite number of different points
satisfying these requirements, it is also required to discover and trace
the curve containing all such points.[³⁰¹ Pappus says that when there
are only three or four lines given, this line is one 01 1116 three conic
sections, but he does not undertake to determine, describe, or explain
the nature of the line required¹³⁷¹ when the question involves a greater
number 01 lines. He only adds that 1116 ancients recognized one 01
1116111 which they had shown to be useful, and which seemed the sim-

[³⁴¹ This rather obscure passage may be translated as follows: “For in this are
agreed those who formerly interpreted these things (that the dimensions 01 a
figure cannot exceed three) in that they maintain that a figure that is contained by
these lines is not comprehensible in any way. This is permissible‚ however, both
to say and to demonstrate generally by this kind 01 proportion, and in this man-
ner: If from any point straight lines be drawn making given angles with straight
lines given in position: and if there be given a ratio compounded 01 them, that
is the ratio that one 01 1116 lines drawn has to one, the second has to a second,
the third to a third. and so on to the given line. if there be seven lines, or, 11 there
be eight lines, 01 1116 1351 10 3 1351, 1116 point lies on the lines that are given in
position. And similarly, whatever may be the odd or even number, since these,
as I have said, correspond in position to the 10111· 111165; therefore they have not
set forth any method so that a line may be known.'' The meaning 01 1116 passage
appears from that which follows in the text.

to egln.
