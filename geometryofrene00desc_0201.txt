write in the dividend (for the opposite sign from that obtained by the
multiplicatiori must always be used). Adding --ΙΞΛῃν2 and —43'2 Ι
have —1283v². Dividing this by —16 Ι have —1—8y2 in the quotient, and
multiplying by y² Ι have —8y4 to be added to the corresponding term.
—8y4‚ in the dividend. This gives —16324 which divided by —16 yields
-l-y‘* in the quotient and —y6 to be added to —1—3·⁰ which gives zero, and
shows that the division is finished.

If, however. there is a remainder, or if any modified term is not

exactly divisible by 16, then it is clear that the binomial is not a
divisor.[²¹⁶¹

two of these need be considered, namely (1² and a2—l—c‘2. The others give
a term in the quotient of lower or higher degree than the known qnan-
tity of the next to the last term, and thus render the division impos-
sible.[²¹⁷³ Note that Ι ani here considering ΝΘ as of the third degree,
