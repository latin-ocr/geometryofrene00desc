ditioii is wanting, the other conditions being such that (as in this exam-
ple) all the points of a single line will satisfy them. If the line is
straight or circular, it is said to be a plane locus ; but if it is a parabola.
a hyperbola, or an ellipse. it is called a solid locus. In every such case
an equation can be obtained containing two unknown quantities and
entirely analogous to those found above. If the curve up'on which the
required point lies is of higher degree than the conic sections, it may

[125]

be called in the same way a supersolid locus, and so on for other
cases. If two conditions for the determination of the pointhare lacking,
the locus of the point is a surface, which may be plane. spherical, or
more complex. The ancients attempted nothing beyond the composition
of solid loci, and it would appear that the sole aim of Apollonius in his
treatise on the conic sections was the solution of problems of solid loci.

Ι have shown, further, that what Ι have termed the first class of
curves contains no others besides the circle, the parabola, the hyperbola‚

and the ellipse. This is what Ι undertook to prove.
