SECOND BOOK

Suppose the curve EC to be described by the intersection of
the ruler GL and the rectilinear plane figure CNKL, whose side
KN is produced indefinitely in the direction of C, and which, being
moved in the same plane in such a way that its side[⁸²¹ KL always coin-
cides with some part of the line BA (produced in both directions),
imparts to the ruler GL a rotary motion about G (the ruler being
hinged to the figure CNKL at L).[⁸³¹ If I wish to find out to what
class this curve belongs, Ι choose a straight line, as AB, to which to
refer all its points, and in AB 1 choose a point A at which to begin the
investigation.¹⁸⁴¹ I say “choose this and that,’' because we are free to
choose what we will, for, while it is necessary to use care in the choice
in order to make the equation as short and simple as possible, yet no
matter what line I should take instead of AB the curve would always
prove to be of the same class, a fact easily de1no1istrated.¹⁵⁵¹

[⁸²¹ “Diametre.”
[⁸³¹ The instrument thus consists of three parts, (1) a ruler ΑΚ ot indefinite

length, fixed in a plane; (2) a ruler GL, also of indefinite length, fastened to a
pivot, G, in the same plane, but not on AK; and (3) a rectilinear figure BKC, the
side KC being indefinitely long, to which the.ruler GL is hinged at L, and which
is made to slide along the ruler GL.
1⁸⁴] That is, Descartes uses the point A as origin, and the line AB as axis of
abscissas. He uses parallel ordinatos, but does not draw the axis of ordinates.
1⁸⁵¹That is, the nature of a curve is not affected by a transformation of

coordinateS.
