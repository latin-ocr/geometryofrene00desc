plus or minus any other quantity. Therefore the equation can have
only the four roots. 2, 3, 4. and 5⁰⁹⁵] ΝΕ can determine also the num-

ber of true and false roots that any equation ean have, as followsz¹¹⁹⁶¹

 

An equation can have as many true roots as it contains changes of sign,
from —l— to — or from — to —l—; and as many false roots as the num-
ber of times two -l- signs or two — signs are found in succession.
Thus, in the last equation, since —l—x4 is followed by —4.2·³‚ giving a
change of sign from -Ι- to —‚ and -19.ι·2 is followed by —l—lOGx and
—l—lOox by —120, giving two more changes, we know there are three
true roots: and since —4x3 is followed by --19Δι-2 there is one false root.
It is also easy to transform an equation so that all the roots that
were false shall become true roots, and all those that were true shall
become false. This is done by changing the signs of the second, fourth,

ever, before his time. for Harriot had given it in his Artis analyticae praxis, Lon-
