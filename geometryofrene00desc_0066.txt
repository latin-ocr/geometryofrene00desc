GEo M ETRY

Probably the real explanation of the refusal of ancient geometers to
accept curves more complex than the conic sections lies in the fact that
the first curves to which their attention was attracted happened to be
the spiral‚¹⁶⁸¹ the quadratrix,¹“‘⁴¹ and similar curves, which really do
belong only to mechanics‚ and are not among those curves that Ι think
should be included here, since they must be conceived of as described
by two separate movements whose relation does not admit of exact
determination. Yet they afterwards examined the conclioid‚[⁷⁰¹ the
cissoid,¹⁷¹³ and a few others which should be accepted; but not knowing
much about their properties they took no more account of these than
of the others. Again, it may have been that, knowing as they did only
a little about the conic sections.¹⁷²] and being still ignorant of many of
the possibilities of the ruler and compasses‚ they dared not yet attack
a matter of still greater difficulty. Ι hope that hereafter those who are
elever enough to make use of the geometric methods herein suggested
will find no great difficulty in applying them to plane or solid problems.
I therefore think it proper to suggest to such a more extended line of
investigation which will furnish abundant opportunities for practice.

Consider the lines AB„ AD, AF, and so forth (page 46), which we
may suppose to be described by means of the instrument YZ. This
instrument consists of several rulers hinged together in such a way that
YZ being placed along the line AN the angle XYZ can be increased or
decreased in size, and when its sides are together the points B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, all coincide with A; but as the size of the angle is increased,
