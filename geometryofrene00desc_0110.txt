Next, suppose that wc have four parallel 111165, and a fifth line cutting
them, such that the parallelepiped 01 111166 111165 drawn through the
point C (one to the cutting line and two to two of the parallel lines)
is equa] to the parallelepiped 01 two lines drawn through C to meet the
other two parallels respectively and another given line. In this 6356

the required point 1165 011 3 curve of different nature, namely, a
curve such that, all the ordinates to its axis being equa] to the ordinates
01 3 601116 56611011, 1116 segments 01 1116 axis between the vertex and
the ordinates1¹2⁰1 bear the same ratio to a certain given line that this
line bears to the segments 01 1116 axis 01 1116 601116 56611011 having equal
ordinates.¹¹³⁰¹

Ι cannot say that this curve is 1655 simple than the preceding: indeed,
Ι have always thought the former should be considered first, 511166 115
description and the determination 01 115 6011311011 are somewhat easier.

I shall not stop to consider in detail the curves corresponding to the
other cases, for I have not undertaken to give 3 complete discussion of
the subject ; and having explained the method 01 determining an infinite
number 01 points lying on any curve, I think 1 have furnished a way
to describe them.

abscissa 01 3 point on 3 601116 56611011 whose ordinate is the same 35 11131 of the
given point, and 3 given line. Cf. Rabuel, pp. 270, et seq.
