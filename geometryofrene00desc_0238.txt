GEOMETRY

Indeed, these ternis are much less complicated than the others. and

they might be made even more concise by the use 01 some particular

symbol to express such chordsfffl] just as the symbol V 15 used to
represent the side 01 3 cube.

By methods similar to those already explained, we can express the
roots 01 any biquadratic equation, and there seems to me nothing fur-
ther to be desired in the matter: for by their very nature these roots
cannot be expressed in simpler ternis, nor can they be determined by
any constuction that is at the same time easier and more general.

It is true that Ι have not yet stated my grounds 1οΓ daring to declare
a thing possible or impossible, but 11 11 15 remembered that in the method
Ι 1156 311 problems which present themselves to geometers reduce to a
single type. namely, to the question 01 finding the values 01 1116 10015
01 311 equation, it will be clear that a list can be made 01 311 1116 ways 01
finding the roots. and that it will then be easy to prove our method the
simplest and most general. Solid problems in particular cannot. as I
have already said. be constructed without the use 01 3 curve more com-
plex than the circle. This follows at once from the fact that they all

reduce to two constructions, nalnely, to one in which two mean pro-

bolism. This suggestion was never adopted.
