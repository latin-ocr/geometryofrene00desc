tains surds, change them as far as possible into rational numbers, either
by multiplication or by one of several other ,methods easy enough to
find. Second. by examining in order all the factors of the last term,
determine whether the left member of the equation is divisible¹²¹²¹ by a
binomial consisting of the unknown quantity plus or minus any one of
these factors. If it is, the problcm is plane, that is, it can be constructed
by means of the ruler and compasses3 for either the known quantity
of the binomia] is the required root[²¹³¹ or else, having divided the left
member of the equation by the binomial, the quotient is of the second

degree. and from this quotient the root can be found as explained in

the first book.¹²¹⁴¹
Given, for example. 3¹⁶—8y4—l24y2264 Ξ O.¹²’⁶³ The last term, 64,

is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 8. 16, 32, and 64: therefore we must find whether
the left member is divisible by 312—1, 37²—l—l‚ 312—2, §1²42- 322—4, and
so on. We shall find that it is divisible by ,ψ’-16 as follows:

-Ι- 37‘5 — 83¹4 — 124372 — 64 Ξ O
Ξ r 8³* - W
O — 16ν4 - 1283ss

 

 

—16

Reginning with the last term, l divide —64 by —16 which gives —l—4;
write this in the quotient: multiply —l—-l by —l—y2 which gives —l—4y2 and

[²¹⁵] Descartes considers this equation as a function of 3›².
