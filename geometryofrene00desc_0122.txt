left the square of CM, or {2²—ZTbCZ-4—2by-y2. Again, taking the

square of FM from the square of FC we have the square of CM
expressed in another way, namely: 5²†2c3—2cy—y². These two expres-
sions being equal they will yield the value of y or MA, which is

d²z²÷2cd²q—e²z²÷2bdez
2bd²÷2cd2 '

 

Substituting this value for y in the expression for the square of CM,

we have

If now we suppose the line PC to meet the curve at right angles at C,
and let PC=s and PA=v as before, PM is equal to v—y: and since
PCM is a right triangle, we have s2—zf22f2vv—m2 for the souare of
CM. Substituting for N its value, and equating the values of the square
of CM, we have

2bcd²2 — Zbcdez — ch2112— Zbdevz— bd²s² -†- ba'2v‘2 —cd²s² ÷cd²v² — Ο

for the required equation.

Such an equation having been found¹¹⁴⁹¹ it is to be used, not to deter-
mine x, ν, or 2, which are known, since the point C is given, but to
find v or s, which determine the required point P. With this in view,
observe that if the point P fulfills the required conditions, the circle
about P as center and passing through the point C will touch but not
eut the curve CE: but if this point P be ever so little nearer to or far-

ther from A than it should be, this circle must eut the curve not only

¹¹⁴⁹] Three such equations have been found by Descartes, namely those for the
ellipse, the parabolic conchoid‚ and the curve Just described.
