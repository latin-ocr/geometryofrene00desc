Divide' this by a²m and multiply the quotient by 1⁷³², since these terms
express the ratio between the diameter and the latus rectum. The result is

This quantity being subtracted from the rectangle previously obtained,

It follows that CL is an ordinate of an ellipse or circle applied to NL,
the segment of the axis.
