1 could give here several other ways of tracing and conceiving a

series of curved lines, each curve more complex than any preceding
onef⁷⁶¹ but Ι think the best way to group together all such curves and
then classify them in order, is by recognizing the fact that all points of
those curves which we may call “geometric‚'' that is, those which admit
of precise and exact measurement, must bear a definite relation¹⁷⁷l to

all points of a straight line, and that this relation must be expressed by

[75⁸]

means of a single equation. If this equation contains no term of

higher degree than the rectangle of two unknown quantities, or the
square of one, the curve belongs to the first and simplest class‚¹⁷”] which
contains only the circle, the parabola. the hyperbola, and the ellipse:

but when the equation contains one or more terms of the third or fourth

[ευ]

degree in one or both of the two unknown quantitieslffl] (for it

requires two unknown quantities to express the relation between two
points) the curve belongs to the second class: and if the equation con-
tains a term of the fifth or sixth degree in either or both of the unknown
quantities the curve belongs to the third class, and so on indefinitely.

¹⁷⁰¹ “Qui seroient de plus en plus composees par degrez a l'infini.’' The French
quotations in the footnotes show a few variants in style in different editions.

[⁷⁷] That is, a relation exactly known, as, for example, that between two straight
lines in distinction to that between a straight line and a curve, unless the length
of the curve is known.

1⁷³¹st will be recognized at once that this statement contains the fundamental
concept of analytic geometry.

[π’] “Du premier ἅ plus simple genre.” an expression not now recognized. As
now understood. the order or degree of a plane curve is the greatest number of
points in which it can be cut by any arbitrary line. while the class is the greatest
number of tangents that can be drawn to it from any arbitrary point in the plane.

1⁸⁰] Grouped together because an equation of the fourth degree can always be
transformed into one of the third degree.
