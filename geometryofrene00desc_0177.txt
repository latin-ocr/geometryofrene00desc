care the simplest curve that can be used in the solution of a problem‚
but it should be noted that the simplest means not merely the one most
easily described, nor the one that leads to the easiest demonstration or
construction of the problem, but rather the one of the simplest class
that can be used to determine the required quantity.

For example, there is, I believe, no easier method of finding any num—

ber of mean proportionals‚ nor one whose demonstration is clearer.
than the one which employs the curves described by the instrument
XYZ, previously explai11ed.[¹⁸⁰] Thus, if two mean proportionals
between YA and ΥΕ be required, it is only necessary to describe
