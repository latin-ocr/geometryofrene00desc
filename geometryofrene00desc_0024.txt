PROBLEMS THE CONSTRUCTION or lecn REQUIRES ONLY STRAIGHT

LINES AND CIRCLES

ANY problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such ternis that
a knowledge of the lengths 01 66113111 straight lines is sufficient
for its constructi011.[¹¹ Just as arithmetic consists of only four or five
operations. namely, addition, subtraction. niultiplication. division and the
extraction of roots, which may be considered a kind of division, so in
geometry, to find required lines it is merely necessary to add or subtract
other lines; or 6156, taking One line Which Ι 511311 6311 unity in order to

which is to one of the given lines as unity is to the other (which is
equivalent to division) t or, finally, to find one, two. or several mean
