Furthermore‚ to determine the point C, but one condition is needed,
namely, that the product of a certain number of lines shall be equal to,
or (what is quite as simple). shall bear a given ratio to the product of
certain other lines. Since this condition can be expressed by 3 single
equation in two unknown qiiantities‚[³²¹ we may give any value we please
to either ,v or 3¹ and find the value of the other from this equation. It
is obvious that when not more than five lines are given, the quantity x,
which is not used to express the first of the lines can never be of degree

higher than the second.[‘''³l

Assigning 3 value to 3¹, we have x²= ss ax 5¹: b‘·', and therefore ,τ
can be found with ruler and compasses. by a method already explained.¹⁵⁴]
If then we should take successively an infinite number of different
values for the line y, we should obtain an infinite number of values for
the line x, and therefore an infinity of different points, such as C, by
means of which the required curve could be drawn.

This method can be used when the problem concerns six or more

lines, if some of them are parallel to either AB or BC, in which case

le point C, il n'y a qu'une seule condition qui soit requise, 3 scavoir que ce qui est
produit par la multiplication d'un certain nombre (le ces lignes soit egal, ou (ce qui
n'est de rien plus mal-aise') ait la proportion donnee, 3 ce qui est produit par la
multiplication des autres: on peut prendre a discretiori l'une des deux quantitez

texts of different editions are of 110 moment, but arc occasionally introduced as
matters of interest. “

¹⁵³¹ Since the Droduct of three lines bears 3 given ratio to the Droduct of two
others and a given line, 110 term can be of higher degree than the third. and there-
fore, than the second in x.
