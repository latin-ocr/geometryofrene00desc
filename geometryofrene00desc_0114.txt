Nevertheless‚ since strings can bc used in these constructions only to
determine lines whose lcngths are known, they need not be wholly
excluded.

When the relation between all points of a curve and all points of a
straight line is k1iow11,[¹³⁷¹ in the way I have already explained, it is easy
to find the relation between the points of the curve and all other given
points and lines; and from these relations to find its diameters‚ axes,
center and other lines¹¹³⁸¹ or points which have especial significance for
this curve, and thence to conceive various ways of describing the curve,
and to choose the easiest.

By this method alone it is then possible to find out all that can be
and there is 110 need

for further explanation from me.
