If ΗΥ 15 greater 111311 HF, the curve CY must be the first part of
the third class of oval, which 1135 already been designated by 3A3.

But suppose that ΗΥ 15 1655 111311 FY. This includes two cases:
111 1116 first, HY exceeds HF by such 311 3111011111 11131 the 13110
01 111611 difference to the whole line ΡΥ 15 greater than the ratio 01 e,
the 511131161 01 1116 two lines 11131 represent the 16113611ν6 power, to d,
the larger; that is. 11 ΗΡΞσ, and HYzc—l—lz, then dh is greater than
Zce—ff—elz. In this case CY must be the second part 3Y3 01 1116 same
oval 01 1116 third 61355.

In the second 6356 dh is less 111311 01 equa] to &eff—elz, and CY is the
second part 2X2 01 1116 01131 01 1116 56601161 61355.

Finally, 11 1116 points H 31161 F 6011161616, FY=FC and the curve
YC 15 3 611616.

It 15 3150 necessary to determine CAC, the other 51111366 01 1116 lens.
11 we suppose the says falling 011 11 10 be parallel, this will be 311 ellipse
having H 35 0116 01 115 foci, 31161 1116 101111 15 easily determined. If,
however, we suppose the rays to 601116 110111 1116 point G, the lens must
have the form 01 1116 first part 01 311 ova] 01 1116 first 61355, 1116 two 1061
