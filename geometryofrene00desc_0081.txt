in the first class.¹⁹¹¹

Having now made a general classification of curves, it is easy for me
to demonstrate the solution which I have already given of the prob- >
lem of Pappus. For, first, I have shown that when there are only three
or four lines the equation which serves to determine the required
points[⁹⁵¹ is of the second degree. It follows that the curve containing
these points must belong to the first class, since such an equation
expresses the relation between all points of curves of Class I and all
points of a fixed straight line. When there are not more than eight
given lines the equation is at most a biquadratic‚ and therefore the
resulting curve belongs to Class H or Class Ι. When there are not
more than twelve given lines, the equation is of the sixth degree or
lower, and therefore the required curve belongs to Class ΙΙΙ or a lower

class, and so on for other cases.

Now, since each of the given lines may have¹ any conceivable posi-
tion, and since any change in the position of a line produces a corre-
sponding change in the values of the known quantities as well as in
the signs -Ι- and -— of the equation, it is clear that there is no curve
of Class I that may not furnish a solution of this problem when it
relates to four lines, and that there is no curve of Class ΙΙ that may not
furnish a solution when the problem relates to eight lines, none of
Class ΠΙ when' it relates to twelve lines, etc. It follows that there is
no geometric curve whose equation can be obtained that may not be

used for some number of lines.¹⁹⁶¹

It is now necessary to determine more particularly and to give the
method of finding the curve required in each case, for only three or

[⁹4³ Various methods of tracing curves were used by writers of the seventeenth
century. Among these there were not only the usual method of plotting a curve
from its equation and that of using strings, pegS, etc.‚ as in the popular construc-
tion of the ellipse, but also the method of using jointed rulers and that of using
one curve from which to derive another, as for example the usual method of
describing the cissoid. Cf. Ralniel, p. 138.

etre receue en Geometrie, qui n’y soit utile pour quelque nombre de lignes.”
