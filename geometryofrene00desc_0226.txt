obtained. This equation will be of the form 3⁴ z p52—qz†r, and 111616-
fore the line GK, or ε, 15 1116 1001 of this equati0n‚ which was to be
proved. If you will apply 11115 1116111011 111 311 1116 011161· 63565, with 1116
proper changes of sign, you will be eonvineed of its 1156111111655, without
my writing anything further about it.

Let 115 apply it 10 1116 problem of finding two 1116311 91090111011315

between the lines a and q. It is evident that if We represent one of the
2 2 3

1116311 proportionals by ε’, 111611 <1:2⁴ :Z : ῥα z ‘⁶61 :ZY Thus we have an
2³
equation between q andffi, namely‚ 23za2q.

Describe 1116 parabola FAG with its axis along AC, and with
AC equa] 10 {cn 11131 15, 10 half 1116 131115 rectum. Then 61661 CE

eqnal 10 {q and perpendicular 10 AC 31 C, and describe the circle AF
