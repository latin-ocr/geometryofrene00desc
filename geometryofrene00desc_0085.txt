SECOND BOOK

It is here assumed that ez is greater than 693 otherwise the signs -l—
and —— must all be changed.¹¹'⁷J If 3¹ is zero or less than nothing in this
equationf‘ffl] the point C being supposed to lie within the angle DAG,
then C must be supposed to lie within one of the angles DAE, EAR,
or RAG, and the signs must be changed to produce this result. If tor
each of these four positions 3¹ is equal to zero, then the problem admits

of no solution in the case proposed.
Let us suppose the solution possible, and to shorten the work let us

write 2m instead of ᾅέῗξΞίΞΞΖ-ἳ, and ξ instead of Ἥ.

Then we have

3³² = 2my -— 'Zssn :ry -4- b—chl.v — bey—‘92²'

of which the root¹⁹⁹¹ is

Again, for the sake of brevity, put —— Z -4- 'est &32 equal to 0, and
2
{dl—2 — ‘’ffb—&39⁸2 equal to Ξ; tor these quantities being given, we can

represent them in any way we please.¹¹⁰⁰³ Then we have
γεω-ἕλ’ -4- 1)ιῖ -Ι- ox -fi-{ffl

This must give the length of the line BC, leaving AB or x undeter-

[⁰⁷¹ When ez is greater than σῃ, then (²3² —— 6932 is positive and its square root
is therefore real.

[⁹⁸] Descartes uses “moindre que rien'' for “negative”

[⁹⁹] Descartes mentions here only one root; of course the other root would fur-
nish a second locus.

[¹⁰⁰¹ In a letter to Mersenne (Cousin‚ Vol. VII, p. 157), Descartes says: “In
regard to the problern of Pappus, I have given only the construction and demon-
stration without putting in all the analysis; . . . in other words, I have given the
construction as architects build structures, giving the specifications and leaving
the actual manual labor to carpenters and masons.”
