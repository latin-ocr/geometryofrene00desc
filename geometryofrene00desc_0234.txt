Fin'ally, suppose that we have 3³ -= ps—q. Construct the circle NQPV

 

whose radius ΝΟ is eqnal toxs—ss—p, and let NP, equa] to ἐξ, be in-

scribed in this circle; then ΝΩ, the cbord of one—third the arc NQR
will be the first of the required roots, and NV, the chord of one-third
the other are, will be the second.

An exception must be made in the case in which the square ot' half
the last term is greater than the cube of one-third the coeffieient of the
next to the last term ξω] for then the line NP cannot be inscribed in

the circle, since it is longer than the diameter. In this case, the two

equation 3⁷³ Ξ 3z-t—c1 by transforming the latter into an equation whose roots have
the opposite signs. Then the true roots of :3 :3s—q are the false roots of
,7³ Ξ 33-1-(1 and vice-versa. Therefore FL z NQ ’1- ΝΡ 15 now the true root.
