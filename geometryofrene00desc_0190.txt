by increasing the roots by a quantity greater than any of the false
roots¹²⁰³¹ we make all the roots true. When this is done. there will be
no two consecutive -1- or — ternis: and further. the known quantity
of the third term will be greater than the square of half that of the
second term. This can be done even when the false roots are unknown,
since approximate values can always be obtained for them and the roots
can then be increased by a quantity as large as 01· larges than is

required. Thus, given,
