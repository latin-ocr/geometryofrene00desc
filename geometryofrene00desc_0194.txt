We· can also multiply or divide all the roots of 311 equation by 3
given quantity, without first determining their valucs. To do this, sup-
pose the unknown quantity when multiplicd or ‹livided by the given
number to bc equa] to a second unknown quantity. Thcn multiply or
divide the known quantity of the second term by the given quantity,
that in the third term by the square of the given quantity, that in the
fourth term by its cube, and so 011, 10 1116 end.
