portionals are to be found between two given lines, and one in which
two points are to be found which divide a given arc into three equa]
parts. Inasmuch as the curvature of a circle depends only upon a sim-
ple relation between the center and all points on the circumference. the
circle can only be used to determine a single point between two
extremes, as, for example, to find one mean proportional between two
given lines or to bisect a given arc; while, on the other hand, since
the curvature of the conic sections always depends upon two different
things.¹²⁴³¹ it can be used to determine two different points.

For a similar reason. it is impossible that any problem of degree more
complex than the solid, involving the finding of four mean proportion-
als or the division of an angle into five equal parts, can be constructed
by the use of one of the conic sections.

Ι therefore believe that I shall have accomplished all that is possible
when I have given a general rule for constructing problems by means
of the curve described by the intersection of a parabola and a straight
line, as previously explained ;[²⁴⁴³ for I am convinced that there is noth-
ing of a simpler nature that will serve this purpose. You have seen,
too, that this curve directly follows the conic sections in that question
to which the ancients devoted so much attention, and whose solution
presents in order all the curves that should be received into geometry.

[ms] As, for example, the distance of any point from the two foci. ¹Descartes
does not say “all points on the circumference‚'’ but “tontes ses parties.’'
