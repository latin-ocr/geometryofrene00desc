(see pages 137 and 138). as the vertex. C as a point on the 6111·ν6,’”””Ι
and F as one of the foci. It then remains to determine H, the other
focus. This may be found by considering that the difference between
FY and FC is to the difference between ΗΥ and HC as d 15 to e: that

15 to the shorter, as 15 evident from the manner os describing the ovals.

Since the lines FY and FC are given we know their difference: and
then, since the ratio of the two differenees 15 known, we know the dif-
ference between HY and HC.

Again, 511166 ΥΜ 15 known, we know the difference between MH
and HC, and therefore CM. It remains to find ΜΗ, the side of the
right triangle CMH. The other side of this triangle, CM, 15 known.
and also the difference between the hypotenuse, CH and the required
side, MH. We can therefore easily determine ΜΗ as follows:
