Let ⁴ the required 111165 be AB, IH, ΕΤ), GF. and CA, and
let it be required to find the point C, such that if CB, CF, CD, CH, and
CM be drawn perpendicular respectiver to the given 111165, 1116 paral-
lelepiped of the three 111165 CF, CD, and CH shall be equal to that 01
1116 011161 two, CB and CM, and 3 third line AI. Let Css=y‚ Csz,
ΑΙ 01 ΑΕ 01 GE=a; whence if C 1165 between AB and DE. we have
CF=2a-3r, CD¹=a—3r‚ and CH=3r†a. Multiplying these three to-
gether we get 313-20312-0331-1-203 equal to the product of the other
three, namely to axy.

I shall consider next the curve CEG which I imagine 10 be described
by the 11116156611011 01 1116 parabola CKN (which is made to move so
that its axis KL always lies along the straight line AB) with the ruler
GL (which rotates about the point G in such a way that it constantly
lies in the plane of the parabola and passes through the point L). I
take KL equal to a and let the principal parameter, that 15, 1116 par-
ameter corresponding 10 1116 axis 01 1116 given parabola, be also equal 10
α, and let GA=20, CB or ΜΔΖ-11, CM 01 Asszx. Since the triangles
GMC and CBL are similar, GM (or 2a—3v) is to MC (or x) as CB

(or y) is to BL, which is therefore equal to {g} . Since KL is a, ΒΚ

fore C is the required point.
