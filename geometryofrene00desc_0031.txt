ally the relations between these lines, until we find it possible to express
a single quantity in two ways.[¹¹¹ This will constitute an equation‚ since
the ternis of one of these two expressions aie together equa] to the
terms of the other.

We must find as many such equations as there are supposed to be
unknown lines :¹¹²¹ but if, after considering everything involved, so many
cannot be found, it is evident that the question is not entirely deter-
mined. In such a case we may choose arbitrarily lines of known length
for each unknown line to which there corresponds no equation.¹¹³¹

If there are several equations‚ we must use each in order. either con-
sidering it alone or comparing it with the others, so as to obtain a value
for each of the unknown lines: and so we must combine them until
there remains a single unknown linem which is equal to some known
line, or whose square, cube, fourth power, fifth power, sixth power,
etc., is equal to the sum or difference of two or more quantities,[¹⁵¹ one
of which is known, while the others consist of mean proportionals
between unity and this square, or cube, or fourth power, etc.. multiplied
by other known lines. Ι may express this as follows:

That is, z, which I take for the unknown quantity, is equal to b: or,
the square of z is equal to the square of b diminished by α multiplied
by 2,· or, the cube of z is equal to α multiplied by the square of ε, plus
the square of b multiplied by z. diminished by the cube of c; and sim-
ilarly for the others.

[111 That is we must solve the resulting simultaneous equations.

[¹²¹Van Schooten (p 149) gives two problems to illustrate this statement. Of
these, the first is as follows: Given a line segment AB containing any point C,
required to produce AB to D so that the rectangle AD. DE shall be equal to the
square on CD. He lets AC— - a, CB z b, and BD— — a. Then AZR- - α —l— b -1- x,
α — b ‘

[¹³¹ Rabuel adds this note: “We may say that every indeterminate problem is an
infinity of determinate problems or that every problem is determined either by
itself or by him who constructs it'’ (p. 21).
