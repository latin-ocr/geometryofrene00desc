Every equation can have¹¹⁸⁴1 as many distinet roots (values of the

unknown quantity) as the number of dimensions of the unknown
quantity in the equati011.¹¹⁵⁵¹ Suppose, for example, x Ξ 2 or ,ι’-2 = O,
and again, x: 3, or ,π’-3 ΣΟ. Multiplying together the two equa-
tions ,r —2 ΞΟ and Δι’-3 1 O. we have -1·²—5.v÷6 = O, or χ’] = ,Μ’-6.
This is an equation in which ‚r has the value 2 and at the same ti1ne1¹⁸⁰¹
x has the value 3. If we next make ,ι’-420 and multiply this by
x2—5-2-÷6=O. we have ,1r2—9.1·2÷26.1·—24=O another equationy in
which x, having three dimensions, has also three values‚ namely‚ 2, 3,
and 4.

It often happens, however, that some of the roots are falsel¹⁸⁷¹ or less
than nothing. Thus, if we suppose ‚r to represent the defeetsm‘q of a quan- ι
tity 5, we have ,tul—5 Ξ O which, multiplied by .1·³—9.v²-{-26x—24 ΞΟ,
yields x4—4ffl—19‚2·2†106.1·—12O ——- O, an equation having four roots,
namely three true roots, 2, 3, and 4, and one false root, 5.[¹⁸⁹¹

It is evident from the above that the summm of an equation having
several roots is always divisible by a binomial consisting of the unknown
quantity diminished by the value of one of the true roots, or plus the
value of one of the false roots. In this way,[¹⁹¹¹ the degree of an equa-
tion can be lowered.

On the other hand, if the sum of the terms of an equatio111¹⁹²¹ is not
divisible by a binomial consisting of the unknown quantity plus or

not “must have,” since he is considering only real positive roots.

[¹⁸⁵] That is as the number denoting the degree of the equation.

for example, does not admit negative quantities as roots of an equation. scritti de

them, but calls them “aestimationes falsae*y or “tiene'’ and attaches no special sig-
nificance to them. See Cardan, Ars Elsaynaq, Nurnberg. 1545, p. 2. Stifel called
them “Numeri absurdi‚'’ as also in Rudolff's Coss. 1545.
