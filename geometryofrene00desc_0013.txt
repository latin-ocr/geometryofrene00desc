Preface

If a mathematician were asked to name the great epoch-making
works in his science, he might well hesitate in his decision concerning
the product of the nineteenth century; he might even hesitate with
respect to the eighteenth century; but as to the product of the sixteenth
and seventeentli centuries, and particularly as to the works of the
(ireeks in classica] 1111165, 116 would probably have very definite view-s.
He would certainly include the works 01 Euclid, Archimedes, and
Apollonius among the products of the Greek civilization, while among
those which contributed to the great rcnaissance of mathematics in the
seventeenth century he would as certainly include La Geometrie of
Descartes and the Principia of Newton.

But it is one 01 1116 curious facts in the study 01 historical material
that although we have long had the works 01 Euclid, Archimedes,
Apollonius, and Newton in English, the epoch-making treatise of Des-
cartes has never been printed in our language, or, if 50, only in some
obscure and long-since-forgotten edition. VVritten originally in Freneh,
it was soon after translated into Latin by Van Schooten, and this was
long held to be sufficient for any scholars who might care to follow
the work of Descartes 111 1116 first printed treatise that ever appeared
on analytic geometry. At present it is doubtful if many mathemati-
cians read the work in Latin; indeed, it is doubtful if many except the
French scholars consult it very 011611 111 1116 original'language in which
it appeared. ssut certainly a work of this kind ought to be easily access-
ible to American and Uritish students 01 1116 history of mathematics,
and in 3 language with which they are entirely familiar.

On this account, The Open Court Publishing Company has agreed
with the translators that the work should appear in English, and with
such notes as may add to the ease with which it will be read. To this
organization the translators are indebted for the publication 01 1116
book, a labor 01 love on its part as well as on theirs.

As to the translation 115611, 311 attempt has been made to give the
meaning of the original in simple English rather than to add to the dif-
ficulty of the reader by making it a verbatim reproduction. It is
believed that the student will welcome this policy, being content to go
to the original in case a stricter translation is needed. One of the
translators having used chiefly the Latin edition 01 Van Schooten, and
the other the original French edition, it is believed that the meaning
which Descartes had in mind has been adequately preserved.
