01 0116 01 1116 third class. Finally, if AM is equal to

AC and CY must both be hyperbolas.

These two problems can be extended to an infinity of 011161 63565
which I will not stop to deduce, since they have no practical value in
dioptrics‚

I might go 13111161 and show how. if one surface 01 3 16115 15 given
and is neither entirely plane nor composed 01 601116 sections or circles,
the other 51111366 6311 be so determined as to transmit 311 1116 rays from
3 given point to another point, 3150 given. This is no more difficult
than the problems Ι have just explained: indeed, it is much 635161 511166
1116 way is now open: Ι prefer. however. to leave this 101 0111615 10
work 0111, 10 1116 end that they may appreciate the more highly the dis-
covery 01 111056 things 11616 (16111011511316(1, through having themselves
10 111661 501116 difficulties.

In all this discussion Ι have considered only curves 11131 6311 1)6
described upon 3 013116 51111366, but my remarks can easily bemade to
apply to all those curves which can be conceived 01 35 generated by 1116
regular niovement 01 1116 points 01 3 body in 111166-(111116115101131 space.[¹⁷'³¹
This can be done by dropping perpendiculars 110111 63611 001111 01 1116
curve under consideration upon two planes intersecting at right angleS.
for the ends 01 111656 perpendiculars will describe two other curves, one
in each 01 1116 two planes. all points 01 which may be deterinined in the
way already explained, and all 01 which may be related to those 01 3
straight line common to the two planes: and by means 01 111656 1116
0011115 01 1116 three-dimensional curve will be entirely determined.

¹¹⁷⁸] This is the hint which Descartes gives 01 the possibility 01 1116 extension 01
his theory to solid geometry. This extension was effecte-d largely by Parent (1666-
1716), Clairaut (1713-1705), and Van Schooten (d. 1661).
