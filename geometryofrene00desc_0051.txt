such that the product of certain of them is equa] to the product of the
rest, 01 31 least such that these two products shall have a given ratio,
for this condition does not make the problem any more difficult.

First, Ι suppose the thing done. and since so many lines are confus-
ing, Ι may simplify matters by considering one of'the given lines and
one of those to be drawn (as, for example, AB and BC) as the prin-
cipal lines, to which 1 shall try to refer all the others. Call the segment
of the line AB between A and* B. x, and call BC, y. Produce all the
other given lines to meet these two (also produced if necessary) pro-
vided none is parallel to either of 1116 principal lines. Thus, in the
figure, the given lines cut AB in the points A, E, G, and cut BC in the
points R, S, T.

Now, since all the angles of the triangle ΑΗΒ 316 l<nown‚[⁴¹⁷³l the ratio
between the sides AB and BR is l<1iown.[⁴⁴] If we 161 AB :BRzz .·b,

we have CRzy—l— κς. (When R lies between C and Β, CR is equal
