An exception must be made when ox is equal to zero, in which case the

Za ⁷24² and the diameter is Zm. From these data the

 

latus rectum is ΡΖ

curve can be determined in accordance with the third problem of the
first book of Apollonius.[¹²²¹

The demonstrations of the above statements are al] very simple, for,
forming the productum] of the quantities given above as latus rectum,
diameter, and segment of the diameter NL or ΟΡ, by the methods of
Theorems 11, 12, and 13 of the first book of Apollonius, the result will
contain exactly the terms which express the square of the line CP or

CL, which is an ordinate of this diameter.
