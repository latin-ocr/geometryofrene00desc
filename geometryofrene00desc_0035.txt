I shall therefore content myself with the statement that if the stu-
dent, in solving these equations, does not fail to make use of division
wherever possible, he will surely reach the simplest terms to which
the problem can be reduced.

And if it can be solved by ordinary geometry, that is, by the use of
straight lines and circles traced on a plane sursace‚¹¹⁰¹ when the last
equation shall have been entirely solved there will remain at most only
the square of an unknown quantity, equa] to the product of its root
by some known quantity, increased or diminished by some other quan-
tity also known.¹²⁰¹ Then this root or unknown line can easily be found.
For example, if Ι have ,εἳ-τ az -1- b²,[²¹³ I construet a right triangle NLM
with one side LM. equal to b, the square root of the known quan-
tity 12², and the other side, LN, equal to ᾖα, that is, to half the
other known quantity which was multiplied by 3, which Ι supposed to
be the unknown line. Then prolonging MN, the hypotenuse¹²²¹ of this
triangle. to O, so that ΝΟ is equal to NL, the whole line OM is the

But if Ι have 3¹²=—ay -Ι- b²‚ where y is the quantity whose value
is desired, Ι construet the same right triangle NLM, and on the hypote-
