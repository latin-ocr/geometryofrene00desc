ΟΝ THE NATURE oF CURVED LINEs

HE ancients were familiar with the fact that the problems of geom-

etry may be divided into three classes, namely. plane. solid, and linear
problems.¹⁵⁹¹ This is equivalent to saying that some problems require
only circles and straight lines for their construction, while others
require 3 conic section and still others require more complex curves.¹⁴³‘’¹
I am surprised, however, that they did not go further, and distinguish
between different degrees of these more complex curves. nor do Ι see
why they called the latter mechanical, rather than geometrical.¹⁶¹¹
If we say that they are called mechanica] because some sort of instru-
mentum has to be used to describe them, then we must, to be consistent,

¹⁵⁰³ Cf. Pappus, Vol. I, p. 55, Proposition 5, Book HI: “The ancients consid-
ered three classes of geometric problems. which they called plane, solid, and linear.
Those which can be solved by means of straight lines and circumferences of circles
are called plane problems, since the lines or curves by which they are solved have
their origin in a plane. But problems whose solutions are obtained by the use of
one or more of the conic sections are called solid problems, for the surfaces of solid
figures (conical surfaces) have to be used. There remains a third class which is
called linear because other *lines' than those Ι have Just described, having diverse
and more involved origins‚ are required for their construction. Such lines are the
spirals, the quadmtrix, the conchoid, and the cissoid, all of which have many impor-
tant properties.'’ See also Pappus, Vol. Ι, p. 271.

10⁰]Rabuel (p. 92) suggests dividing problems into classes, the first class to
include all problems that can be constructed by means of straight lines. that is,
curves whose equations are of the first degree; the second. those that require curves
whose equations are of the second degree, namely, the circle and the conic sec-
tions. and so on.

In substance as follows: “Meclzanical is 3 mathematical term designating 3 con-
struction not geometric, that is, that cannot be accomplished by geometric curves
Such are constructions depending upon the quadrature of the circle.

The term, mechanical curve. was used by Descartes to designate a curve that
cannot be expressed by an algebraic equation.” Leibniz and others call them
transcendental.
