(JEOM ETRY

Ι might add several different rules for the solution of cubic and
biquadratie equations but they would be superfluous, since the con-
struction of any plane problem can be found by means of those already
given.

I could also add rules for equations of the fifth, sixth, and higher
degrees, but I prefer to consider them all together and to state the
following general rule:

First, try to put the given equation into the form of an equation
of the same degree obtained by multiplying together two others, each
of a lower degree. If, after all possible ways of doing this have been
tried, none has been sucessful, then it 15 certain that the given equation
cannot be reduced to a simpler one: and, consequendy, if it is of the
third or fourth degree, the problem depending upon it is solid: if of
the fifth or sixth. the problem 15 0116 degree more complex, and so
on. I have also omitted here the demonstration of most of my state-
ments, because they seem to me so easy that if you take the trouble
to examine them systematieally the demonstrations will present them-
selves to you ¹and it will be of much more value to you to learn them

in that way than by reading them.
