THIRD BOOK

The demonstration of all this is very simple. Plaee the ruler ΑΕ
and the parabola FD 5ο that both pass through the point C. This can
always be done, since C lies 011 the curve ACN which is described by

the intersection of the parabola and the ruler. If we let CG =31‚ GD
will equal ³732, since the latus rectum n is to CG as CG is to GD. Then

DE: {jn—u ‚ and subnaeting DE from GD we have GE: 37? — “2272“ .
Since AB is to BE as CG 15 to GE, and AB is equal to. 1„p therefore
BE: ξζῖ- ζίῖ , Now let C be a point on the curve generated

by the intersection of the line SC which is parallel to ΒΚ, and

AC, which is parallel to SV. Let ΞΒ- - CG=3, and BK=n‚ the

latus rectum of the parabola. Then BT z ἦ, for KB 1s to ΒΞ as ΒΞ 15
