either ,ι’ 01· y will be of only the second degree in the equation, so that

the point C can be found with ruler and compasses.

On the other hand, if the given lines are all parallel even though a
question should be proposed involving only five lines„ the point C can-
not be found in this way. For, since the quantity ‚v does not occur at
all in the equation‚ it is no longer allowable to give a known value to y.
It is then necessary to find the value of yffi] And since the term in y
will now be of the third degree. its value can be found only by finding
the root of a cubic equation, which cannot in general be done without

the use of one of the conic sections.¹⁵⁶¹

And furfflermore, if not more than nine lines are given, not all of
them being parallel, the equation can always be so expressed as to be
of degree not higher than the fourth. Such equations can always be
solved by means of the conic sections in a way that Ι shall presently
explai11.[⁵⁷¹

Again‚ if there are not more than thirteen lines, an equation of degree
not higher than the sixth can be employed, which admits of solution by
means of a curve just one* degree higher than the conic sections by a

method to be explained presently.¹⁵⁸¹

This completes the first part of what I have to demonstrate here, but
it is necessary, before passing to the second part, to make some general

statements concerning the nature of curved lines.

¹⁵⁵] That is, to solve the equation for 3¹.

[⁵'³¹ See page 84.

¹³⁷¹ See page 107.

[⁵⁵³] This line of reasoning may be extended indefinitely. Briefly, it means that
for every two lines introduced the equation becomes one degree higher and the
curve becomes correspondingly more complex.
