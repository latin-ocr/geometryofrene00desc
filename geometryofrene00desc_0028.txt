It should also be noted that all parts of a single line should always
be expressed by the same number of dimensions, provided unity is not
determined by the conditions of the problem. Thus, (13 contains as
many dimensions as ab² or b·⁹'‚ these being the component parts of the

line which Ι have called x'Vass—bh—kdb? It is not, however. the same
thing when unity is determined‚ because unity can always be under-
stood, even where there are too many or too few dimensions; thus, if
it be required to extract the cube root of (ΗΡ — b. we must consider the
quantity a²b² divided once by unity, and the quantity b multiplied twice
by unity.[⁷¹

Finally, so that we may be sure to remember the names of these lines,
a separate list should always be made as often as names are assigned
or changed. For example. we may write, AE=L that is AB is equal
to 1 :¹⁸¹ GHza, BD: b, and so on.

If, then, we wish to solve any problem. we first suppose the solution
already effected.¹⁹] and give names to all the lines that seem needt'ul for
its construction,—to those that are unknown as well as to those that
are known.¹¹⁰¹ Then, making no distinction between known and unknown
lines, we must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows most natur-

1⁷1Descartes seems to say that each term must be of the third degree, and that
therefore we must conceive of both a2b² and b as reduced to the proper dimension.

¹⁸¹ Van Schooten adds “seu unitati,'’ p. 3. Descartes writes, AB301. He
seems to have been the first to nse this symbol. Among the few writers who fol-
lowed him, was Hudde (1633-1704). It is very commonly supposed that 00 is a
ligature representing the first two letters (or diphthong) of “aequare'' See. for
example. M. Aubry's note in W. W. R. Ball's Recrdations Mathffmatiques et Prob-

[⁹] This plan, as is well known. goes back to Plato. It appears in the work of
Pappus as follows: “In analysis we suppose that which is required to be already
obtained. and consider its connections and antecedents, going back until we reach
either something already known (given in the hypothesis), or else some fundamen-
tal principle (axiom or postulate] of mathematics.'' Puppi Alexandrini Collectiones
quae supersunt e libris maizu scriptis edidit Latina interpellatione et commentariis
instruxit Fredericus Hultsch„ Berlin, 1876-1878; volt H. p. 635 (hereafter referred
to as Pappus). See also Commandinus, Puppi Alexandrini Mathmnaticae Collec-
tiones. Bologna‚ 1588. with later editions.

Pappus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived about 300 AD.
His most important work is a mathematical treatise in eight books, of which the
first and part of the second are lost. This was made known to modern scholars
hy Commandinus. The work exerted a happy influence on the revival of geometry
in the seventeenth century. Pappus was not himself a mathematician οἱ the first
rank. but he preserved for the world many extracts or analyses of lost works, and
by his commentaries added to their interest.

sor unknown quantities (p. 20).
