GEOBAEETRY

Now the circle FG can cut or touch the parabola in l, 2, 3, or 4
points; and if perpendiculars are drawn from these points upon the
axis they will represent all the roots of the equation, both true and
false. If the quantity q is positive the true roots will be those perpen-
dicfflars, such as FL, on the same side of the parabola, as E,[²²⁸¹ the
center of the circle; while the others, as GK, will be the false roots.
On the other hand, if q is negative, the true roots will be those on the

[229]

opposite side, and the false or negative roots will be those on the

same side as E, the center of the circle. If the circle neither cuts noi
touches the parabola at any point, it is an indication that the equation
has neither a true nor a false root, but that all the roots are imagi-
nary.[²³⁰¹

This rule is evidently as general and complete as could possibly be
desired. Its demonstration is also very easy. If the line GK thus con-
structed be represented by z, then ΑΚ is 3², since by the nature of the
parabola, GK is the mean proportional between ΑΚ and the latus rec-
tum, which is l. Then if AC or {s and CD or ξφ, be subtracted from

ΑΚ, the remainder is DK or EM, which is equa] to 22—{p—{ of which
the square is

zssssff—ffi÷{p½-}p÷{.

And since DE = ΚΜ = ἐ q, the whole line GM =2⁴÷ {ff q, and the square

of GM equals 2²÷q2÷

[²²⁹] “Les fausses ou moindres que rien.” This is the first time Descartes has
directly used this synonym.

[²⁴³⁰] It may be noted that Descartes considers the cubic as a quartic having zero
as one of its roots. Therefore‚ the circle always cuts the parabola at the vertex.
It must then cut it in another point, since the cubic must have one real root. It
may or may not cut it in two other points. It may cut it in two coincident points
at the vertex, in which case the equation reduces to a quadratic.
