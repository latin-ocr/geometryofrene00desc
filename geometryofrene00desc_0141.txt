SECOND BOOK

In the construction of the second oval the only difference is
that instead of AR we must take AS on the other side of A, equal
to AG, and that the radius of the circle about G cutting the circle about

F and passing through 5 must be equa] to the line 562 or if it is to cut
the circle through 7 it must be equal to 58, and so on. In this way the

circles intersect in the points 2, 2, which are points of this second oval
A2X.

To construet the third and fourth ovals (see page 121), issSfffld Of
AG I take ΑΗ on the other side of A. that is, on the same side as F·
It should be observed that this line AH must be greater than AF, which
in any of these ovals may even be zero, in which case F and A coincide-
Then, taking AR and AS each equal to ΑΗ, to describe the third oval,
