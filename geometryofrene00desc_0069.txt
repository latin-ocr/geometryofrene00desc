the ruler BC, fastened at right angles to ΧΥ at the point B, pushes
toward Z the ruler CD which slides along YZ always at right angles.
In like manner, CD pushes DE which slides along YX always parallel
to BC; DE pushes EF: EF pushes FG: FG pushes GH, and so on.
Thus we may imagine an infinity of rulers, each pushing another, half
of thern making equal angles with YX and the rest with YZ.

Now as the angle XYZ is incrcased the point B describes the curve
AB, which is a circle: while the intersections of the other rulers,
namely. the points D, F, H describe other curves, AD, AF, ΑΗ, of
which the latter are more complex than the first and this more complex
than the circle. Nevertheless Ι 566 no reason why the description of
the first¹⁷³¹ cannot be conceived as clearly and distinctly as that of the
circle, or at least as that of the conic sectionsz or why that of the sec-
ond, third.¹⁷⁴³ or any other that can be thus described, cannot be as
clearly conceived of as the first: and therefore Ι 566 no reason why
they should not be used in the same way in the solution of geometric

problems.¹⁷⁵]

[⁷³¹ That is, AD.
