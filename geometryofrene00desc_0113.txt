it, and that used for the spira] and similar curves.[¹³²J In the latter not
any point of the required curve may be found at pleasure, but only such
points as can be determined by a process simpler than that required for
the composition of the curve. Therefore, strictly speaking, we do not
find any one of its points, that is, not any one of those which are so
peculiarly points of this curve that they cannot be found except by
means of it. On the other hand, there is no point on these curves which
supplies a solution for the proposed problem that cannot be determined
by the method Ι have given.

But the fact that this method of tracing a curve by determining a
number of its points taken at random applies only to curves that can
be generated by a regular and continuous motion does not justify its
exclusion from geometry. Nor should we reject the method¹¹³³¹ in which
a string or loop of thread is used to determine the equality or difference
of two or more straight lines drawn from each point of the required

[134]

curve to certain other points, or making fixed angles with certain

other lines. We have used this method in “La Dioptrique

’³ ¹¹⁸⁵] in the

discussion of the ellipse and the hyperbola.

On the other hand, geometry should not include lines that are like
strings‚ in that they are sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since
the ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and Ι
believe cannot be discovered by human 1ni1ids,[¹³⁶¹ and therefore no con-
clusion based upon such ratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact.

¹¹³²¹ That is. transcendental curves, called by Descartes “mechanical‘’ curves.

¹¹³³¹ Cf. the familiar “mechanical descriptions'' of the conic sections.

[¹³³¹ As for example, the foci, in the description of the ellipse.

‘¹³⁶¹ This work was published at Leyden in 1637, together with Descartes's
Disconrs de la Methode.

¹¹³⁶] This is of course concerned with the problem of the rectification of
curves. See Cantor, Vol. II (1), pp. 794 and 807, and especially p. 778. This
statement, “ne pouvant etre par les hom1nes'’ is a very noteworthy one, coming as
it does from a philosopher like Descartcs. On the philosophical question involved,
consult such writers as Bertrand Russell.
