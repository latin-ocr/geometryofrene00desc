nus'e MN lay off NP equal to NL, and the remainder PM is y, the
desired root. Thus Ι have
(ἶ 4· χβὲαῗ -4- [2².

,Ν -- - aff 4- W,

PM would be ‚2³ and Ι should have

 

'1:—

{OM—⁴

In the same way, if I had

 

 

and so for other cases.

Finally, if Ι have ς’] z asfflbss, Ι make NL equal to {5- a and LM equal
to b as before: then, instead of joining the points M and N, Ι
draw MQR parallel to LN, and with N as a center describe a circle
through L cutting MQR in the points Q and R; then z, the line sought‚
is either MQ or MR, for in this case it can be expressed in two ways,
namely :³³⁴¹

 

and

 

[²³¹ Since MRMQ Ξ ΙΙΙΙἹ, then if ΗΖΕ. we have MQza—z, and so
:(a—3): b2 or 52 Ξ aa— b'-‘.

If, instead of this. MQ Ξ ,3, then MR Ξ α — s, and again, 32 z a: — b2. Further-
more, letting O be the mid-point of QR,

Mozomi—oo: ὲα-Χχὲαμ-μ,

 

and

 

MRzMO-POR: ἒα-’ῑ-χχέ 02—172.

Descartes here gives both roots, since both are positive. If MR is tangent to the

circle, that is, if b Ξ ὲ a, the roots will be equal; while if l> > ἔα, the line MR

will not meet the circle and both roots will be imaginary. Also, since RMQM—-ssfflff,
31³2 Ξ b2, and RM -i- QM z 31 433 Ξ α.
