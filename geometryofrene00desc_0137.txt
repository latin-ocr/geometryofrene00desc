SECOND BOOK

Given, for example, CD, the first conchoid of the ancients (see page
113). Let A be its pole and BH the ruler. s'o that the segments of all
straight lines, as CE and DE. converging toward A and included
between the curve CD and the straight line BH are equal. Let it be
required to find a line CG normal to the curve at the point C. In try-
ing to find the point ou BH through which CG must pass (according
to the method just explained). we would involve ourselves in a calcula—
tion as long as, or longer thau any of those just given. and yet the
resulting construction would be very simple. For we need only take
CF on CA equal to CH, the perpendicular to BH: then through F
draw FG parallel to BA aud equa] to EA, thus determining the point
G, through which the required line CG must pass

To show that a consideration of these curves is not without its use,
and that they have diverse properties of no less importance than those
of the conic sections Ι shall add a discussion ot' certain ovals which you
will find very useful in the theory of catoptrics and dioptrics. They
