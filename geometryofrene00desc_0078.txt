If, ‘instead of one of these curves of the first class, there be used a
curve of the second class lying in the plane CNKL, a curve of the third
class will be described; while if one of the third class be used, one of
the fourth class will be obtained, and so on to infinity.['³⁹¹ These state-
ments are easily proved by actual calculation.

Thus, no matter how we conceive a curve to be described. provided
it be one of those which I have called geometric, it is always possible
to find in this manner an equation determining all its points. Now Ι
shall place curves whose equations are of the fourth degree in the same
class with those whose equations are of the third degree; and those
whose equations are of the sixth degree¹⁰⁰¹ ”

whose equations are of the fifth degree and similarly for the rest.

This classification is based upon the fact that there is a general rule for
reducing to a cubic any equation of the fourth degree, and to an equa—

tion of the fifth degree any equation of the sixth degree, so that the
latter in each case need not be considered any more complex than the
former.

It should be observed‚ however, with regard to the curves of any
one class, that while many of them are equally complex so that they
may be employed to determine the same points and construet the same
problems, yet there are certain simpler ones whose usefulness is more
limited. Thus, among the curves of the first class, besides the ellipse.
the hyperbola, and the parabola, which are equally complex, there is
also found the circle. which is evidently a simpler curve: while among
those of the second class we find the common conchoid‚ which is
described by means of the circle, and some others which, though less

cubical parabola, and showing that the resulting equation is of the fifth degree.
and therefore. according to Descartes, of the third class. Rabuel also gives (p. 119).
a general method for finding the curve, no matter what figure is used for CNKL.

This value of s is independent of the nature of the figure CNKL. But given
any figure CNKL it is possible to obtain a second value for s from the nature of
the curve. Equating these values of s we get the equation of the curve.
