SECOND BOOK

The first of these products divided by d is equal to the second divided
by e, whence it follows that PQ: PN=FP.CG: GP.CF=d: e,
which was to be proved. This proof may be made to hold for the
reflecting and refracting properties of any one of these ovals, by proper
changes of the signs plus and minus: ancl as each can be investigated
by the reader, there is no need for further discussion herem]

It now becomes necessary for me to supplement the stateinents made
in my Dioptrique¹¹⁷⁴¹ to the effect that lenses of various forms serve
equally well to cause rays coming from the same point and passing
through them to converge to another point3 and that among such lenses
those which are convex on one side and concave on the other are more
powerful burning-glasses than those which are convex on both sides;
while, on the other hand, the latter make the better telescopes.[¹⁷⁵¹ I
shall describe and explain only those which Ι believe to have the great-
est practica] value‚ taking into consideration the difficulties of cutting.

To complete the theory of the subject, I shall now have to describe

[¹⁷³] To obtain the equation of the first oval we may proceed as follows: Let

Substituting in this equation the value of 3 obtained above, squaring, and simplify-

Platonic school, and burning—glasses. in the forrn of spherical glass shells filled with
water, or balls of rock crystal are discussed bv Pliny, Hist⁴ Nat. xxxvi, 67 (25)
and xxxvii, 10. Ptolemy, in his treatise on Optics, discussed reflection, refraction‚
and plane and concave mirrors.
