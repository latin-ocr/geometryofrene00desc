ellipse ¹and hyperbola are described in La Dioptriqne.¹¹⁶⁶¹ But Ι cannot
give any further attention to this subject.

Athough these ovals seem to be of almost the same nature, they
nevertheless belong to four different classes, each containing an infinity
of sub-classes, each of which in turn contains as many different kinds
as does the class of ellipses or of hyperbolas: the sub-classes depend-
ing upon the value of the ratio of AS to A6. Then, as the ratio of AF
to AG, or of AF to AH changes, the ovals of each sub-class change in
kind, and the length of AG or AH determines the size of the oval.¹¹⁶⁷¹

If AS is equal to A6. the ovals of the first and third classes become
straight lines: while among those of the second class we have all pos-
sible hyperbolas, and among those of the fourth all possible ellipses.¹¹⁶⁸¹

In the case of each oval it is necessary further to consider two por-
tions having different properties. In the first oval the portion toward
A (see page 114) causes rays passing through the air from F to con-
verge towards G upon meeting the convcx surface lAl of a lens
whose index of refraction, according to dioptrics‚ determines such

ratios as that of AS to Af), by means of which the oval is described.

[Μ] See the notes on pagcs 10, 55, 112.

[¹⁰⁷¹ Compare the changes in the ellipse and hyperbola as the ratio of the length
of the transverse axis to the distance between the foci changes.

[¹⁶⁸¹ These theorems may be proved as follows: (1) Given the first oval, with
A51A6;then RAzGA; FP:F5; GP:R6: AR—R6: GA—A51G5.
Therefore FP÷GP Ξ F5-l-G5. That is, the point Ρ lies on the straight line FG.
(2) Given the second oval, with AS Ξ A6; then F2 z FS z FA÷A5;
(32:- 86: SA-l-A6: SA-l-A5; GZ——FZ—-SA—FAzGA—FAzC. There-
fore 2 lies on a hyperbola whose foci are F and G, and whose transverse axis is
GA—FA. The oroof for the third oval is analogous to (1) and that for the
fourth to (2).

It mav be noted that the first oval is the same curve as that described on
page 98. For FP Ξ F5, whence FP — AF z AS, and AR z AG: GP z R6;
AG— GP z A6. If then AS : A6zd : e we have, as before,

FP—AF 2 AG—szd 2 e.
