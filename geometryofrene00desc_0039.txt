And if the circle described about N and passing through L neither
cuts nor touches the line MQR, the equation has no root, so that we
may say that the construction ot' the problem is impossible.

These same roots can be found by many other 1nethods;[²‘³¹ I have
given these very simple ones to show that it is possible to construet
all the problems of ordinary geometry by doing no more than the little
covered in the four figures that I have explainetl.[²“¹ This is one thing
which l believe the ancient mathematicians did not observe, for other-
wise they would not have put so much labor into writing so many books
in which the very sequence of the propositions shows that they did not
have a sure method of finding all.[²⁷1 but rather gathered together those
propositions on which they had happened by accident.

This is also evident from what Pappus has done in the beginning of
his seventh book,[²⁵‘¹ where, after devoting considerable space to an
enumeration of the books on geometry written by his predecessors,¹²⁹¹
he finally refers to a question which he says that neither Euclid nor
Apollonius nor any one else had been able to solve completely ξω] and
these are his words:

“Quem autem dicit (Apollonius) in tertio libro locum ad tres, &-
quatuor lineas ab Euclide perfectum non esse, neque ipse perficere

poterat, neque aliquis alinsl: sed neque paululum qnid addere iis, quse

1²⁶¹It will be seen that Descartes considers only three types of the quadratic
equation in s, nanssely. 32163»- b2 Ξ Ο, 32 —— a: — b2' z Ο, and 32 —- (ις-1- b2 z Ο.
It thus appears that he has not been able to free himself from the old traditions
to the extent of generalizing the meaning of the coefficients, —— as negative and
fractional as well as positive. He does not consider the type 3²-l-az†b²:O‚
because it has no positive roots. 7

of analysis, in the following words: “Illorum librorum, quibus de loco, ἀναλυόμενος
sive resoluto agitur, ordo hic est. Euclidis datorum liber unus. Apollonii de pro-
portionis sectione libri duo, de spatii sectione duo. de sectione determinata duo. de
tactionibus duo, Euclidis porismatum libri tres. Apollonii inclinationum libri duo,
eiusdem locorum planorum duo. conicorum octo, Aristaei locorum solidorum libri
