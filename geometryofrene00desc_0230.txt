of the'two roots, yle, must be taken as the length of the required line
NQ, for the other root, GK, is equa] to NV, the chord subtended by
one-third the arc VNPJWJ which, together with the arc NQP consti-
tutes the circle; and the false root, FL, is equal to the sum of QN and
NV, as may easily be slioxv11.[²³⁵¹

It is unnecessary for me to give other examples here, for all prob-
lems that are only solid can be reduced to such forms as not to require
this rule for their construction except when they involve the finding
of two mean proportionals or the trisection of an angle. This will be
obvious if it is noted that the most difficult of these problems can be
