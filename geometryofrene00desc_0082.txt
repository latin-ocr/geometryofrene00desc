fourgiven lines. This investigation will show that Class I contains
only the circle and the three conic sections.

Consider again the four lines AB, AD, EF, and GH, given before,
and let it be required to find the locus generated by a point
C, such that, if four lines CB, CD, CF, and CH be drawn through it
making given angles with the given lines, the product of CB and CF

is equa] to the product of CD and CH. This 15 equivalent to saying
that if

 

CB = y,
CD Ξ (231 ἦ bcx,
CF Ξ {523³ ‘ff‘ deffssiffl

and CH Ξ 9-——-—-³³' ÷ Ῐξξ -ῗθχ,
