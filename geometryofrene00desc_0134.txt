GEOMETRY

muchlarger volume than I wish to write. I desire rather to tell you
in passing that this method, of which you have here an example, of sup-
posing two equations to be of the same form in order to compare them
term by term and so to obtain several equations from one. will apply
to an infinity of other problems and is not the least important feature
of my general method.¹¹⁶⁰¹

I shall not give the constructions for the required tangents and nor-
mals in connection with the method just explained, since it is always
easy to find them, although it often requires some ingenuity to get short
and simple methods of construction.

¹¹⁶⁰] The method may be used to draw 3 normal to a curve from a given point,
to draw a tangent to 3 curve from 3 point without, and to discover points of
inflexion‚ maxima, and minima. Compare Descartes's Letters, cousin, Vol. VI,

' t). 421. As an illustration. let it be required to find a point of inflexion on the

first cubical parabola. Its equation is 31⁷²:an Assume that D is 3 point of
inflexion‚ and let CD ΞΝ, AC Ξ x. PA z s, and ΑΕ Ξ r. Since triangle PAE is
Υῇ-ὁ-Ξξ, whence xz's'vrrf. Substituting in

 

similar to triangle PCD we have

the equation of the curve, we have yg—ss-faaszo· But if D is a point of

inflexion this equation must have three equal roots, since at 3 point of inflexion
there are three coincident points of section. Compare the equation with

3)ss — 36'372 ‘l- 36²3) — e⁷³ Ξ Ο.
Then 3e² Ξ 0 and e Ξ 0. But e z 31, and therefore 37 z Ο. Therefore the point of
inflexion is (0, 0). Rabuel, p. 321.

It will be of interest to compare the method of drawing tangents given by
Fermat in Methodics ad disquirendum maximam et minimam, Toulouse. 1679,
which is as follows: It is required to draw 3 tangent to the parabola BD from a

point O without. From the nature of the parabola ff> {ti—{⁹ Since O is without the
