expressing the relation between ,r and y is y3—by2—cdy—l—bcd-l—dxy20.
Eliminating x, we have

Arranging the ternis according to the powers of y by sqt1aring.¹¹⁴⁶' this

and so for the other cases. If the points of the curve are not related
to those of a straight line in the way explained, but are related in some
other way.[¹⁴⁷¹ such an equation can always be found.

Let CE be a curve which is so related to the points F. G, and A.
that a straight line drawn from any point on it, as C. to F exceesls
the line FA by a quantity which bears a given ratio to the excess ot* (ΞΑ
over the line drawn from the point C to G.[¹⁴⁸¹ Let GAzb, Acm, and
taking an arbitrary point C on the curve let the quantity by which CF
exceeds FA be to the quantity by which GA exceeds GC as d is to e.
Then if we let z represent the undeterrnined quantity, FC=c†: and

GC=b-{2. Let MA=31, GM=b-y‚ and FMzc-ry. smee CMG is a

right triangle, taking the square of GM from the square of GC we have

[¹⁴⁰¹ “En remettant en ordre ces termes par moyen de la multiplication.”

¹¹⁴⁷] “Mais en toute autre qu'on saurait imaginer.’'
[¹¹⁵¹ That is the ratio of CF—FA to GA- CG is a constant.
