GEOMETRY

If,v however, this method of tracing the curve ACN by the transla-
tion of a parabola seems to you awkward, there are many other ways
of describing it. We might take AB and BL as before (page 226), and
ΒΚ equal to the latus rectum of the parabola, and describe the semi-
circle KST with its center in RK and cutting AB in some point S.
Then from the point T where it ends, take TV toward K equal to BL
and join S and V. Draw AC through A parallel to SV, and draw SC
through S parallel to 131& then C, the intersection of AC and SC will
be one point of the required curve. In this way we can find as many

points of the curve as may be desired.
