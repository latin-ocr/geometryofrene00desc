enee there is between the roots; and when the points coincide, the roots
are exactly equaL that is to say, the circle through C will touch the
curve (ΞΕ at the point C without cutting it.

Furthermore, it is to be observed that when an equation has two
equal roots, its left-hand member must be similar in form to the expres-
sion obtained by multiplying by itself the difference between the
unknown quantity and a known quantity equal to it ;[¹⁵¹¹ and then, if the
resulting expression is not of as high a degree as the original equation,
multiplying it by another expression which will make it of the same
degree. This last step makes the two expressions correspond term by
term.

For example, I say that the first equation found in the present dis-
cussionJ²⁵²¹ namely

must be of the same form as the expression obtained by making e=y
and multiplying y—e by itself, that is, as y2—2ey—l—62. We may then
compare the two expressions term by term, thus: Since the first term,
