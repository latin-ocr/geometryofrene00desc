Now it is evident that 504n²‚ the known quantity¹²⁰⁴¹ of the third term,

is larger than (395N>*; that is, than the square of half that of the sec-

..ι

ond term: and there is no case for which the true roots need be in-
creased by a quantity larges in proportion to those given than for this

one.
If it is undesirable to have the last term zero, as in this case, the

roots must be increased just a little more, yet not too little, for the pur-
pose. Similarly if it is desired to saise the degree of an equation, and
also to have all its terms present, as if instead of x⁷¹—b Ξ O, we wish
an equation of the sixth degree with ΠΟ term zero, first. for ,1⁵³ — b Ξ Ο

write xss— bx Ξ O. and letting ψν —- a z ,ι’ we have
5⁶—6c13=⁵†15a2314-2Oa³3v³†15a⁴y2-(6a³÷b)3v÷a⁶÷ab == O.

It is evident that, however small the quantity α, every term of this equa-

tion must be present.
