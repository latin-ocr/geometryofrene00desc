And thus you see that. no matter how many lines are given in posi-
tion, the length 01 any such line through C making given angles with
these lines can always be expressed by three 1611115, 0116 01 which coh-
sists 01 1116 unknown quantity J' multiplied or divided by some known
quantity: another consisting of the unknown quantity .r multiplied or
divided by some other known quantity: and the third consisting of a
known quantity.[⁴²‘¹ An exception must be made in the case where the
given lines are parallel either to AB (when the term containing ‚r van-
ishes)‚ or to CB (when the term containing 3· vanishes). This case is
too simple to require further explanation.¹⁵⁰³ The signs 01 1116 1611115

may be either -1- 01 -— in every conceivable combination.¹⁵¹]

You also see that in the product 01 any number 01 111656 111165 1116
degree 01 any term containing ‚r 01 31 will not be greater than the num-
ber 01 111165 (expressed by means 01 ,1 and 31) whose product is found.
Thus, no term will be 01 degree higher than the second 11 11νο lines
be multiplied together, nor 01 degree higher than the third, 11 there be

three lines, and so on to infinity.
