Therefore. if we take ΑΡ equal to the above valuc ot' v, all the
terms of which are known, and ioin the point [³ thus determined
to C, this line will eut the curve CE at right angles, which was required.

It should be observed regarding the expression taken arbitrarily to
raise the original produet to the required degree, as we just now took

¹¹⁵⁹] It will be observed that Descartes did not consider a coefficimit, as a, in the
general sense of a positive or a negative ouantitv. but that he alwavs wrote the
sign intended. In this sentence, however, he suggests some generalization.
