a circle upon ΥΕ as diameter cutting the curve AD in D, and YD is
then one of the required mean proportionals. The demonstration
becomes obvious as soon as the instrument is applied to YD, since YA
(or ΥΒ) is to YC as YC is to YD as YD is to YE.

Similarly, to find four mean proportionals between YA and YG, or
six between YA and YN, it is only necessary to draw the circle YFG,
which determines by its intersection with AF the line YF, one of the
four mean proportionals: or the circle YHN, which determines by its
intersection with AH the line YH, one of the six mean pro‘portionals‚
and so on.

But the curve AD is of the second class. while it is possible to find
two mean proportionals by the use of the conic sections, which are

curves of the first class.¹¹'⁵¹I

Again, four or six mean proportionals can
be found by curves of lower classes than AF and ΑΗ respectively. It
would therefore be a geoinetric error to use these curves. On the other
hand. it would be a blunder to try vainly to construet 3 problem by
means of 3 class of lines simpler than its nature allows.[¹⁸²¹

Before giving the rules for the avoidance of both these errors, some
general statements must be made concerning the nature of equations.
An equation consists of several ternis, some known and some unknown,
some of which are together equal to the rest: or rather, all of which
taken together are equa] to nothing: for this is often the best form to

consider.¹¹⁸³¹

¹¹⁸¹] If we let ,r and 3* represent the two mean proportionals between a and b we
have α : xzx : ,ν 1 ,ν ; b, whence 3² z (13oe 3¹² Ξ bx, and ,2¹3y z ab. Therefore
x and 31 may be found by determining the intersections of two parabolas or of 3
parabola and a hyperbola.

before Descartes.
