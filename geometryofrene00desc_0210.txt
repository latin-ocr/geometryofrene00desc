To emphasize the value of this rule, I shall apply it to a problem.
Given the square AD and the line BN, to prolong the side AC to E, so
that EF, laid off from E 011 ΕΡ), 511311 be equal to NB.
Pappus showed that if BD 15 produced to G, 50 11131 DG = DN, and
a circle is described on BG as diameter, the required point E will be
the intersection of the straight line AC (produced) with the circum-
ference of this circle.[²²⁵¹
Those not familiar with this construction would not be likely to dis—
cover 11, and if they applied the inethod suggested here they would
never think of taking DG for the unknown quantity rather than CF
or FD, since either of these would much more easily lead to an equa-

the proof given by Pappus. He first gives an elaborate proof of the following

lemma: Given a square ABCD, and E a point in AC produced, EG perpendicular
to BE at E, meeting BD produced in G, and F the point of intersection of BE and
CD. Then CD2 -1- FE² = DG.² Then he proceeds as follows: By the construe
tion given in the problem, ffi²=ssD²÷ ff? By the lemma, D—G²=CD²†FE².
By construction, BD Ξ CD and DG Ξ DN. Therefore, FE z BN.
