This method can also be used to make the known quantity of any
term equal to a given quantity. Thus. given the equation

x³ — b2x-1- c3 = O,

let it be required to write an equation in which the coefficient of the
third terr11.¹²⁰‘³I namely 12², shall be replaced by Sa? Let

Neither the true nor the false roots are always real: sometimes
they are i1naginary3²⁰³ that is. while we can always conceive of as many
roots for each equation as I have already assig11e‹1.¹²⁰⁸¹ yet there is not
always a definite quantity corresponding to each root so conceived of.
Thus, while we may conceive of the equation .1·“'—(]x‘²—†—l3‚r—lO=O
as having three roots. yet there is only one real root, 2. while the other
two, however we may increase, diminish‚ or multiply them in accord-
ance with the rules just laid down. remain always imaginary.

XVhen the construction of a problem involves the solution of an
equation in which the unknown quantity has three di1nensi0ns.¹²“⁰³ the
following steps must be taken:

First, if the equation contains some fractional coefficients,[²¹⁰¹ change
them to whole numbers by the method explained above ς12111 if it con-

s²⁰⁶¹ Descartes wrote this equation x * μῦἶῃ--ῧ-ΓἿ 00 Ο, the star showing, as
explained on page 163, that a term is missing. Hence. he speaks of —ls-‘x as the
third term.

classification, signifying that we mav have owsitivc and negative roots that are
imaginary. The use of the word “imaginary'' in this sense begins here.

¹²⁰³] This seems to indicate that Descartes realized the fact that an equation of
the nth ,degree has exactly n roots. Cf. Cantor, Vol. II(l ), 1). 724.

[²⁰⁹] That is. a cubic equation.

“numeri rotti‘’ of the Italians. The expression “broken numbers'' was often used
by early English writers.

1²¹¹]That is. transform the equation into one having integral coefficients.
