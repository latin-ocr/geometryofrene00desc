This shows that αῗ-ᾕ-σ2 is the required root, which can easily be proved
by multiplication.

But when no binomial divisor of the proposed equation can be found,
it is certain that the problem depending upon it is solid,[²¹⁸¹ and it is then
as great a mistake to try to construet it by using only circles and straight
lines as it is to use the conic sections to construet a problem requiring
only circles; for any evidence of ignorance may be termed a mistake.

Again, given an equation in which the unknown quantity has four

dimensions.[²¹⁹¹ After removing any surds or fractions, see if a binomial
having one term a factor of the last term of the expression will divide
the left member. If such a binomial can be found, either the known
quantity of the binomia] is the required root, or‚[²²⁰¹ after the division is
performed, the resulting equation, which is of only three dimensions,
must be treated in the same way. If no such binomia] can be found.
we must increase or diminish the roots so as to remove the second term,
in the way already explained, and then reduce it to another of the third

degree, in the following manner: Instead of

,2¹4 ss px² ss (μ’ ss r = O
write
ff ss 2l⁷3¹⁴ ψ (ff ss 4rh'2 — ι]2 = ΟΨ]

[²¹³¹ That is, that it involves a conic or some highcr curve.
[²¹⁹¹ Α biquadratic equation.
[²²⁰¹ “Either, or,'' as in the original. It is like saying that the root of x2-—a210

is either x z a or ,τ z -α,
[²²¹¹ Descartes wrote substantially “Instead of

· -l- .2‘4*. p.2·x.q.2⁴.r χ) O
write
÷x⁰·2l⁷.x·⁴† (pp-4¹²)xy ——qq »ο Ο.”

The symbolism is characteristic of Descartes.
