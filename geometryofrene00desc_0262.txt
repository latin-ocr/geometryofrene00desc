GEOM ETRY

But it is not my purpose to write a large book. Ι am trying rather
to include much in a few words, as will perhaps be inferred from what
I have done, if it is considered that, while reducing to a single construc-
tion 311 the problems of one class, I have at the same time given a
method of transforming them into an infinity of others, and thus of⁴
solving each in an infinite number of ways3 that. furthermore, having
constructed all plane problems by the cutting of a circle by a straight
line, and all solid problems by the cutting of 3 circle by a parabola} and,
finally, all that are but one degree more complex by cutting a circle by
a curve but one degree higher than the parabola, it is only necessary to
follow the same general method to construet all problems‚ more and
more complex, ad infinitum; for in the case of 3 mathematical progres-
sion, whenever the first two or three terms are given, it is easy to find
the rest. .

I hope that posterity will judge me kindly, not only as to the things
which I have explained, but also as to those which I have intentionally

omitted so as to leave to others the pleasure ot‘ discovery.
