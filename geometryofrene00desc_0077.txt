From this equation we see that the curve EC belongs to the first class,

it being, in fact, a hyperbola.¹⁸⁶¹

If in the instrument used to describe the curve we substitute for the
rectilinear figure CNK this hyperbola or some other curve of the first
class lying in the plane CNKL, the intersection of this curve with the
ruler GL will describe, instead of the hyperbola EC, another curve.

which will be of the second class.
Thus, if CNK be a circle having its center at L, we shall describe

the first conchoid of the a11cients,¹⁸⁷¹ While if we use a parabola having
KB as axis we shall describe the curve which, as I have already said,
is the first and simplest of the curves required in the problem of Pappus,
that is, the one which furnishes the solution when five lines are given

in position.¹⁸⁸¹

sions, trans. by J. H. Boyd, New York, 1896, p. 143.

The two branches ot' the curve are determined by the position of the triangle
CNKL with respect to the directi-ix AB. See Rabuel, p. 119.

Van Schooten, p. 171, gives the following construction and proof: Produce
AG to D, making DG: EA. Since E is a point of the curve obtained when
GL coincides with (ΞΑ, L with A. and C with N, then EAzNL. Draw DF
parallel to KC. Now let GCE be a hyperbola through E whose asymptotes
are DF and FA. To prove that this hyperbola is the curve given by the instru-
ment described above, produce BC to cut DF in I, and draw DH parallel to AF

 

meeting BC in H. Then KL : LN z DH z HI. But DH z ΑΒ z x, so we may

But in any hyperbola IC.BC z DE.EA, whence we have (a-l-c— -ῖ ——wyz oc,

therefore the equation of a hyperbola whose asymptotes are AF and FD.

Van Schooten, p. 172, describes another similar instrument: Given a ruler
AB pwoted at A, and another BD hinged to AB at B. Let AB rotate about A
so that D moves along LK; then the curve generated by any point E of BE will
