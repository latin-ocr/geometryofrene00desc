Taking this from the square of IC there remains the square of CM, or

and this is equal to the square of GH, previously found. This may be

written

whence it appears that the lines CG, NR, QO, etc„ are the roots of this
equation.
If then it be desired to find four mean proportionals between the
lines α and b, if we let ,τ be the first, the equation is x5—a⁴b=0 οι·

Therefore, we must take AB εἶτα, and ΒΚ, the latus rectum of the
