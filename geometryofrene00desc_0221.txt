THIRD BOOK

If the equation contains -Ι- r, on one side of ΑΕ produced, lay off
AR equal to ν, and on the other side lay off As equa] to the latus
rectum of the parabola, that is, to 1, and describe a circle On RS as
diameter. Then if ΑΗ is drawn perpendicular to ΑΕ it will meet the
circle RHS in the point H, through which the other circle FHG must
pass.

If the equation contains — r, construet a circle upon ΑΕ as
diameter and in it inscribe AI, a line equal to AHffffl then the first
circle must pass through the point Ι.

[²²⁷¹ That is, draw a chord equal to ΑΗ.
