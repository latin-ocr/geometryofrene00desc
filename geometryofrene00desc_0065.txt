SECOND BOOK

reject circles and straight lines, since these cannot be described on
paper without the use of compasses and a ruler‚ which may also be
termed instruments. It is not because the other instruments, being
more complicated than the ruler and compassos, are therefore less
accurate, for if this were so they would have to be excluded from
mechanics, in which accuracy of construction is even more important
than in geometry. In the latter, exactness of reasoning alone¹⁶²¹ is
sought‚ and this can surely be as thorough with reference to such lines
as to simpler ones.¹‘³⁴¹ I cannot believe, either, that it was because they
did not wish to make more than two postulates, namely, (1) a straight
line can be drawn between any two points, and (2) about a given center

a circle can be described passing through a given point. In their treat--
ment of the conic sections they did not hesitate to introduce the assump-
tion that any given cone can be cut by a given plane. Now to treat all
the curves which Ι mean to introduce here, only one additional assump-
tion is necessary, namely, two or more lines can be moved, one upon
the other, determining by their intersection other curves. This seems
to me in no way more difficult.¹⁶⁵¹

It is true that the conic sections were never freely received into
ancient geometry,¹⁶⁶¹ and I do not care to undertake to change names
confirmed by usage: nevertheless, it seems very clear to me that if we
make the usual assumption that geometry is precise and exact, while
mechanics is not :¹⁶⁷¹ and if we think of geometry as the science which
furnishes a general knowledge of the measurement of all bodies, then
we have no more right to exclude the more complex curves than the
simpler ones, provided they can be conceived of as described by a con-
tinuous motion or by several successive motions, each motion being
completely determined by those which precede; for in this way an exact
knowledge of the magnitude of each is always obtainable.

¹⁶³¹ An interesting question of modern education is here raised, namely. to what
extent we should insist upon accuracy of construction even in elementary geometry.

¹⁶⁴¹ Not only ancient writers but later ones, up to the time of Descartes, made
the same distinction; for example, Vieta. Descartes's view has been universally
accepted since his time.

¹⁶⁶¹ That is, in no way less obvious than the other postulates. ⁸
