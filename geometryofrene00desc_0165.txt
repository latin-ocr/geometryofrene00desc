which enables us to determine the required point A.

Again. suppose that only the points G, C, and F are given. together
With the ratio of AM to YM: and let it be required to determine the
form of the lens ACY which causes all the rays coming from the point
G to converge to F.

In this case. wc can use two ovals, AC and CY, with foci G and H,
and F and H rcspcctively. To determine these„ let us suppose first
that H, the focus common to both, is known. Then AM is determined
by the three points G. C, and H in the way just now explained: that is
if k represents the difference between CH and HM, and y the differ-
ence between GC and GM, and if AC be the first part of the oval of the

We may then find MY by means of the three points F, C, and H.
If CY is the first part of an ova] of the third class and we take 3¹ for

MY and f for the differencc between CF and FM, we have the dif- ’
