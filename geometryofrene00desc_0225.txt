for the square of GE, since GE is the hypotenuse of the right triangle
EMG.
But GE is the radius of the circle FG and ean therefore be expressed

in another way. For since ED :33 q, and AD = ὲ ρ-Ι- ὲ, and ADE is
a right angle, we have

 

EA=xsssq²÷ {pffir 3}er ξ.

Then, Since HA is the mean proportional between AS or 1 and AR or r,

HA: κῘῆ and since EAH is a right angle, the square of HE or of EG is
1 2 1 2 1 1
494- 4p-l- 2fi÷ 4 ÷r‚

and we can form an equation from this expression and the one already
