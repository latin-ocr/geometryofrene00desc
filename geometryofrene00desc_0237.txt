roots that were true are merely imaginary. and the only real root is the
one previously false. which according to Cardan’s rule is

d}q†xs}q²-217p³ ψ ἦχὲφ-χχὲ 9²-217p3-

Furthermore it should be remarked that this method of expressing the

 

 

 

roots by means of the relations-which they bear to the sides of certain

[²⁴⁰] ⁸

cubes whose contents only are known is in no respect clearer or
simpler than the method of expressing them by means of the relations
which they bear to the chords of certain arcs (or portions of circles)‚
when arcs three times as long are known. And the roots of the cubic
equations which cannot be solved by Cardan's method can be expressed
as clearly as any others, or more clearly than the others. by the method
given here.

For example. grant that we may consider a root of the equation

2³ = —qz÷p known, because we know that it is the sum of two lines

of which one is the side of a cube whose volume is ὲ) q increased by the

side of a square whose area is ᾗ q²— ᾗ 15³, and the other is the side of

another cube whose volume is the difference between ὲ q and the side

of a square whose area is ὲ q2- 31—7253. This is as much knowledge of

the roots as is furnis-hed by Cardan's method. There is no doubt that
the value of the root of the equation z³= ψέγε-ρ is quite as well
known and as clearly conceived when it is considered as the length of a

chord inscribed in a circle of radius xl} and subtending an arc that

is one-third the arc subtended by a chord of length δέ.

[²⁴⁰¹ Descartes here makes use of the geometrical conception of finding the cube
root of a given quantity.
