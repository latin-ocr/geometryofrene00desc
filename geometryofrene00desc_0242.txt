When quantities required for the construction of these problems are
to be found, you already know how an equation can always be formed
that is of no higher degree than the fifth or sixth. Yon also know how
by increasing the roots of this equation we can make them all true, and
at the Same time have the coefficient of the third term greater than the
square of half that of the second term. Also‚ if it is not higher than
the fifth degree it can always be changed into an equation of the sixth
degree in which every term is present.

Now to overcome all these difficulties by means of a single rule, I
shall consider all these directions applied and the equation thereby
reduced to the form:

96-ΜΜπΨ-ννᾋενὲ-ΐνψυ = O

in which q is greater than the square of ἦ p.
