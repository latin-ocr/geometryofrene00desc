C would lie on the straight line IL ;¹¹⁰⁴¹ that if it were a perfect square,

that is if m² and Ξ x2 were both —l—¹¹⁰⁵¹ and 0² was equal to 4pm‚ or if

m² and ox, or ox and Ξ x2, were zero, then the point C would lie on

another straight line, whose position could be determined as easily

as that of 1L.1¹⁰·¹
If none of these exceptional cases occur,[¹⁰⁷¹ the point C always lies

on one of the three conic sections, or on a circle having its diameter
in the line IL and having LC a line applied in order to this diameter,¹¹⁰⁸¹
or, on the other hand, having LC parallel to a diameter and IL applied

in order.

In particular, if the term ᾖ ‚15² is zero, the conic section is a parabola;

if it is preceded by a plus sign, it is a hyperbola; and, finally, if it is
preceded by a minus sign, it is an ellipse.¹¹⁰⁹¹ An exception occurs when

notalis.'’ The French edition, Paris, 1705, has “C’est a dire que mm et ἐπε etant

marquez d'un meme signe -l- ou -—.'’ Rabuel gives “C’est a dire que mm and

dans les Editions Francoises de Leyde, 1637, et de Paris, 1705, ‘un meme signe ’l-

of y is linear in x and 31, and therefore represents a straight line. If the quantity

under the radical sign and {x are both zero, the line is parallel to AB. If the

quantity under the radical sign and m are both zero, C lies in AL.
[mg] “An ordinate.⁷' The equlvalent os “ordinat-ion applicatioiffl was used in the
16th century translation of Apollonius. Hutton's Mathematical Dictionary, 1796,

gives “applicate.” “Ordinate applicate,'’ was also used.
