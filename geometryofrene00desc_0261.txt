For the circle about Ι 35 center will pass through the point P thus
found, and cut the curve in the two points C and N. If we draw the
perpendiculars NR and CG, and subtract NR, the smaller‚ from CG.
the greater, the remainder will be x, the first of the four required mean
proportionals.[²⁴⁰³

This method applies as well to the division ot' an angle into five equal
parts, the inscription of 3 regular polygon of eleven or thirteen sides
in 3 circle, and an infinity of other problems. It should be remarked,
however, that in many of these problems it may happen that the circle
cuts the parabola of the second class so obliquelysffl that it is hard to
determine the exact point of intersection. In such cases this construc-
tion is not of practica] value.¹²³'¹¹ The difficulty could easily be overcome
by forming other rules analogous to these, which might be done in a
thousand different ways.

[²⁴⁴ 9] The two roots of the above equation in 3) are NR and CG. But we know
that α is one of the roots ot' this equation and therefore NR the shorter length,
must be α and CG must be 3=. Then x. - -3 —az CG— NR, the first of the
required mean proportionals. Rabuel 9 580.
