tion. They would thus get an equation which could not easily be solved
without the rule which Ι have Just explained.
For, putting (ι for BD or CD, c for EF and ,τ for DF, we have

CF = av—x, and, since CF is to FE as FD is to BF, we have
a—x: c =.1-:BF,

whence BF ——- 29¹⁷: e.

and by the preceding rule we know that its root, which is the length of

If, on the other handy we consider BF, CE, or BE as the unknown
quantity, we obtain an equation of the fourth degree. but much easier
to solve, and quite simply obtained.[²²⁶]

Again, if DG were used, the equation would be much more difficult
to obtain, but its solution would be very simple. Ι state this simply to
warn you that, when the proposed problem is not solid, if one method
of attack yields a very coinplicated equation a much simpler one can
usually be found by some other method.
