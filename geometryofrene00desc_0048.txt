FinaHy, the first and simplest curve after the conic sections is the
one generated by the intersection of a parabola with a straight line in

a way to be described presently.

Ι believe that Ι have in this way completely accomplished what
Pappus tells us the ancients sought to do, and Ι will try to give the
demonstration in a few words, for Ι am already wearied by so much
writing.

Let AB, AD, EF, GH, be any number of straight lines
given in positi011,¹⁴²¹ and let it be required to find a point C, from which

straight lines CB. CD. CF, CH, . . . can be drawn, making given angles
CBA, CDA, CFE, CHG‚ respectively‚ with the given lines, and

¹⁴²¹ It should be noted that these lines are given in position but not in length.
They thus become lines of reference or coordinate axes, and accordingly they
play a very imnortant Dart in the development of analytic geometry. ln this con-
nection we may quote as follows: “Among the predecessors of Descartes we
reckon, besides Apollonius. especially Vieta. Oresrne, Cavalieri, Roberval. and
Fermat, the last the most distinguished in this field; but nowhere, even by Fermat,
had any attempt been made to refer several curves of different orders simultane-
ously to one system of coordinates. which at most possessed special significance
for one of the curves* It is exactly this thing which Descartes systematically
accomplished.'’ Karl Fink, A Brivf History of Matlzcnzatics, trans. by Bernan and
Smith, Chicago, 1903, p. 229.

Heatli calls attention to the fact that “the essential difference between the
Greek and the modern method is that the Greeks did not direct their efforts to
making the fixed lines of a figure as few as possible, but rather to expressing
their equations between areas in as short and s²mple a form as possible.’' For fur-
ther discussion see D. E. Smith. History of ΑῚΙαῘΙιιἾιιαΐιὶιτ, Boston, 1923-25, Vol. II,
pp. 316-331 (hereafter referred to as Smith).
