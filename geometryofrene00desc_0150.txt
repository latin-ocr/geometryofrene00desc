is considerably greater than AF, such 3 11111101 will be convex in the
center (toward A) and concave at each end; 101 such 3 curve would
be heart-shaped rather than oval. The other part, X2, is 11561111 101
refracting Ienses: rays which pass through the air toward F are 16-
11361661 by 3 16115 whose 51111366 1135 11115 form.

The third oval 15 01 1156 only 101 refraction, and causes rays travel-
ing through the air toward F (page 121) to move through the glass
toward H, 31161 they have passed through the 51111366 whose form is
AssY3, which is convex throughout except toward A, where it is slightly
concave, so that this curve is also heart-shaped. The difference between
the two parts 01 11115 oval is that the one part is nearer F and 13111161
110111 H, while the other is nearer H and 13111161 110111 F.

Similarly‚ the last 01 111656 ovals is 11561111 only in the 6356 01 reflec-
tion. Its effect is to make all rays coming 110111 H (see 1116 566011(1
figure on page 121) and meeting the concavo 51111366 01 3 mirror of
the same material as those previously discussed, and 01 1116 form
A424, converge towards F after reflection.

The points F, G and H may be called the “burning points'’¹¹⁶⁹¹ 01
111656 ovals, to correspond to those 01 1116 ellipse and hyperbola, and
they are 50 named in dioptrics.
