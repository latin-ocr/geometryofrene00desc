SECOND BOOK

There are many other ways of describing these same ovals. For
example, the first one, AV (provided we assume FA and AG
equal) might be traced as follows: Divide the line FG at L so that
FL ζ LG=AS : ΑΟ, that is, in the ratio corresponding to the index
of refraction. Then bisecting AL at K, turn a ruler FE about the
point F, pressing with the finger at C the cord EC, which, being
attached at E to the end of the ruler, passes from C to K and then
back to C and from C to G, where its other end is fastened. Thus the
entire length of the cord is composed of GA-ffffALArFss—AF, and the
point C will describe the first oval in a way similar to that in which the
