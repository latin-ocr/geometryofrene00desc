a²m is e‘qual to 175² and the angle ILC is a right angle,¹¹¹⁰¹ in which case
we get a circle instead of an ellipse.¹¹¹¹¹

If the conic section is a parabola, its latus rectum is equal to ξ and

its axis always lies along the line IL.¹¹¹²¹ To find its verteX‚ N, make

IN equal to

 

ΗΖ , so that the point Ι lies between L and N if νηὶ is posi—

tive and os is positive; and L lies between I and N if m² is posi-
tive and ox negative; and N lies between I and L if 112² is negative and
ox positive. It is impossible that 772² should be negative when the terms
are arranged as above. Finally, if m² is equal to zero, the points N and
Ι must coincide. It is thus easy to determine this parabola, according
to the first problem of the first book of Apollonius¹¹¹³¹.

If, however, the required locus is a circle, an ellipse, or a hyper-

bolaf¹¹⁴³ the point M, the center of the figure, must first be found. This

Therefore, the coefficients of x2 and 322 are unity and the locus is a circle.

treated as a special form of the ellipse, but being mentioned separately in all cases
