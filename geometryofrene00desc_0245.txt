Now place the plane containing the parabola on that containing the

lines AB and RK, in such a way that the axis DE of the parabola falls

 

along the line ΒΚ. Take a point E such that DE = 29722( and place a

ruler so as to connect this point E and the point A of the lower plane.
Hold the ruler so ‘that it always connects these points, and slide the

parabola up or down, keeping its axis always along RK. Then the
