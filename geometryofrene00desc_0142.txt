A3Y', Ι draw a circle about H as center with a radius equal to §6 and
cutting in the point 3 the circle about F passing through 5, and another
with a radius equa] to §8 cutting the circle through 7 in the point also
marked 3, and so on.

Finally, for the fourth oval, Ι draw circles about H as center with
radii equal to Ro, RS, and so on, and cutting the other circles in the

points marked 4.¹¹⁸⁵¹

[¹⁶³¹ In all four ovals AF and AR or AF and AS intersect at A under any
angle. F mav coincide with A, and otherwise its distance from A determines the
size of the oval. The ratio· AS : A6 is determined by the index of refraction os
the material used. In the first two ovals. if A does not coincide with F it lies
between F and G, and the ratio AF : AG is arbitrary. In the last two, if F does
not coincide with A it lies between A and H, and the ratio AF z AH is arbitrary.
In the first oval AR: AG and the points R, 6, 8 arc on the same side of A. In
the second oval AS z AG and S is on the opposite side of A from 6, 8. In the
third oval AS z AH and S is on the opposite side οἱ A from 6, 8. In the fourth
oval AR ΖΑΗ and R, 6, 8 are on the same side of A. RabueL p. 342.
